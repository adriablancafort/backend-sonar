“Esta ambición me está matando” (“This ambition is killing me”) are the first words Nathy Peluso belts out in “Corleone”, the bold opening track of her new powerful album, GRASA. This phrase sets the tone for this sophomore effort, which reveals a more mature and emboldened Nathy who asserts her unique capabilities as a songwriter and performer, seamlessly navigating rap, ballads, and tropical genres. For the first time, the Argentine-born, Spain-based artist reveals a more intimate and personal side in her lyrics, unafraid to open up about the growing pains and creative crises that come with fame, success and the pressures of modern stardom. 

Nathy co-produced and co-wrote the 15 tracks in the album. Most tracks are the result of a close collaboration with Venezuelan musician and producer Manuel Lara (Kali Uchis, Bad Bunny) who also serves as executive producer with Nathy. ‘GRASA’ draws visual and stylistic inspiration from a diverse array of references - the cinematic grandeur of mafia lore, 1970s NYC salsa, current icons like Kendrick Lamar - but grounded in a contemporary sound. The album feels like the soundtrack of Nathy’s current moment as she pushes boundaries and defies expectations in her craft. It’s also the triumphant result of a deeply personal journey. 

Her critically acclaimed 2020 debut album Calambre catapulted Nathy to fame and success, winning “Best Alternative Album” at the 2021 Latin GRAMMYs, scoring hits with Bizarrap, C Tangana and Tiago PZK, playing Coachella, selling out two Movistar Arenas in Buenos Aires and touring all over Spain. But her signature zeal and grueling work ethic came at a personal cost. In between performing, brand deals and releasing new music, in 2022 and 2023 she quickly got to work in the writing and production of new material that would serve as a follow up album. “It’s rooted in me, I’m a strong woman, but I lost track of my own humanity,” she says of her self-imposed high standards, which coupled with the pressures of the industry, and a series of romantic heartbreaks, compromised her mental health and left her emotionally unfulfilled. “I was like a robot telling myself, ‘I’m a gladiator’. But I had to relearn how to enjoy simple things in life that were not work.”

She credits her mentor and friend, Argentine icon Fito Páez, with helping her find her creative center. Last summer, she decided to take a break and go on a vacation. Nathy and Páez ended up in the same location on vacation, and she confided in him that she felt “so lost.” Nathy arrived at a hard realization: she had to discard the 20 plus tracks that didn’t feel right. She felt she was letting her team and everybody around her down. Páez encouraged her to find a conceptual framework to create new music.“Something so small, so simple ignited something in me and sent me off to focus,” says Nathy. 
 
GRASA is anchored in three musical pillars: hip hop, tropical and ballads and she embodies these different genres with craft, precision and skill. Thematically, is Nathy’s own personal soundtrack with a cinematic velour. She says: “It stems from my private life and my honesty. Previous songs I’ve done have been perhaps more fantastical, I’ve made up imaginary characters…This album is deeply personal.” 
 
Going to therapy and taking time off helped Nathy replenish herself as a person and as an artist, to learn once again how to enjoy the music creation process. “This album takes the learnings of what I went through. I’ve decided to talk about my private life, which is something I had never exposed before,” she says. 

Fans will be delighted to hear Nathy’s rapping in full force across several tracks in GRASA, something she wanted to do more of for them. In “Todo Roto”, featuring Paco Amoroso and Ca7riel, she delivers strong bars and invites listeners on a journey of self-discovery, challenging them to confront their fears and embrace their true selves, along with her.  Another rap, “Aprender a Amar,” is an ode to self-love co-written and co-produced by indie alternative artist pablopablo. “It’s like a mantra I’m telling myself and the whole world,” says Nathy. “It’s essential and you can’t achieve it overnight. It’s work until the day you die.”  
For Nathy, the single “Legendario” is the most powerful track in the album, “In the end, what matters is doing something that lasts, whether it's small or huge, but something in which you feel that you did the best and that remains for your history,” she says.  “I’ve learned to enjoy what I’m most passionate about, which is writing, being an artist, and embrace my own sensibility.” 
 
For Lara, Nathy is on her way to becoming legendary herself. “Legends break the mold, reinvent themselves. Nathy has that.” 
 
Nathy and Lara clicked at the studio and after that, ‘GRASA’ ended up coming together very fast, in three sessions over six weeks at Sony’s 5020 Studios in both Madrid and Miami. “He is committed, hard-working, respectful, and contributes wonderful things all the time. He’s a Maserati,” she says of Lara. Together, they figured out the framework the album needed (the 1983 iconic movie “Scarface” was always playing in the studio as a visual inspiration throughout the sessions). “The album has a tinge of Tarantino-esque violence, of danger, of passion, of breaking the rules, which represents me because I’m very passionate,” says Nathy. She came in with lyrics and was ready to let go and truly collaborate with Lara as well as multi instrumentalist Ben Aller. 
 
“Nathy is like Pandora's box, a mix of so many things. She knows exactly what she wants”, says Lara, who has a degree in Music Engineering and Production from Berklee College of Music. “The way she expresses her ideas lyrically is one of the most amazing things I've ever seen.” Additional production credits include Colombian producer Casta (Karol G, Manuel Turizo), frequent Nathy collaborator Didi Gutman (María José Llergo, Brazilian Girls) and Sony's own Rafael Arcaute.

In Spanish, ‘GRASA’ evokes many different meanings and cultural subtexts, especially in her native Argentina, where the word can mean “tacky”, “tasteless” or “vulgar”. But Nathy, like her music, doesn't want to limit herself to one definition: it could be how she proudly flaunts her body that doesn't fit the mold of heteronormative expectations while publicly revering a slice of pizza or pasta on her social media feeds. Or it could evoke the richness of her musical arrangements, or even her zealous, all-in attitude of getting her hands dirty, in everything she does. She wants to reclaim the word and make it part of her universe: “For me it's a state of mind, a lifestyle,” she says. 
Standout track 'La Presa', marks the third salsa song in Nathy's repertoire, after “Un veneno” in Calambre and single “Mafiosa”. A salsa song in the classic vein of Hector Lavoe or Rubén Blades, “La Presa '' counts with Venezuelan songwriter-producers Servando Primera and Yasmil Morrufo and is blessed with backup vocals by none other than Jerry Rivas, Luisito Carrión and members of El Gran Combo de Puerto Rico. It’s rare to hear a young female artist masterfully and so sumptuously deliver a salsa song from a woman’s point of view. On top of that, Nathy imbues what could be a mere romantic trope with satire and dark humor. 
 
In “Manhattan”, featuring Argentine trap artist Duki, she rises above her haters. It's rare to hear Nathy addressing them fully-on, but again she stays authentic to her experiences of the last four years as part of her raw honesty. Likewise “Envidia”, preceded by an intro from no other than C-Tangana, is also a theatrical, even humorous take on how poisonous society can be. “Humor is what keeps me alive, I swear,” says Nathy about having the last laugh. “God will always give you an opportunity, but it’s up to you whether you take advantage of it or whether you waste your energy worrying about other people's business.”
 
In an industry often characterized by superficiality, Nathy's authenticity shines through, reminding us that you can be an ambitious powerful woman while also showing vulnerability and being open about navigating life’s challenges. 
 
In that vein, “El día que perdí mi juventud,” is a nostalgic acoustic tune reminiscent of Argentine rosarina trova or Argentine rock pioneer Litto Nebbia. It features producer Dev Hynes (who records under the artistic name Blood Orange) on guitar. Nathy and Hynes, who has produced for Solange, Sky Ferreira, recorded it together at his home studio in London. 
 
In ‘GRASA’, Nathy revels in a newfound willingness to delve into her personal experiences and innermost thoughts. She acknowledges the pressures of fame and the relentless pursuit of success, yet remains resilient in her commitment to self-expression.  She goes all in, uncompromising in showing herself vulnerable and the dark side of fame. She can still be a businesswoman but the struggle is also part of the journey. And she shows us her journey. “It never crosses my mind to throw in the towel. Never. But at what cost? I was empty and dead inside, but kept pushing forward. I needed to recover,” she says. “In this album I feel I can tell my story from a healthier perspective, after having healed certain things but sharing everything that took to get here.”

Es innegable que Alizzz ha marcado un antes y un después en la música española: tanto como productor de un buen puñado de las canciones más representativas de la nueva ola pop (múltiples singles #1, discos de oro, platino y tres Latin Grammys) y como artista en solitario dando rienda suelta a su faceta como frontman. 

Tras el lanzamiento en 2021 de su primer álbum "Tiene que haber algo más", un disco de calado intergeneracional que marcó un punto de inflexión en su carrera recibiendo muy buena acogida por parte de público y prensa, seguido de "Boicot" en 2023, un EP rupturista donde continuó explorando su identidad artística, el catalán regresa con su segundo álbum "Conducción Temeraria".

En este último trabajo Alizzz continúa ahondando en su estilo único, fusionando elementos del pop, el rock y la electrónica, para entregar un disco brillante que logra capturar una mezcla de emociones y experiencias en las que te puedes ver fácilmente reflejado, demostrándonos una vez más su incansable búsqueda para componer canciones rotundas y manteniendo siempre una coherencia en su propuesta artística.
Alizzz es un todoterreno de la producción musical y lo ha vuelto a demostrar en su segundo álbum de estudio, ‘Conducción Temeraria’. Sonidos de motor fusionados con elementos del pop, el indie rock y la electrónica como seña de identidad de su propuesta artística, irrumpirán en la jornada inaugural de Sónar de Día, dónde vuelve dos años después con un directo cargado de referencias a la velocidad y a vivir de manera desenfrenada.

Drawing from real-life medical images and personal history, the show becomes a visceral journey of constraint and liberation, where the violin is both instrument and protagonist.

El violín cuenta una historia de doblegamiento y libertad en el cuadro
de la estructura de una ópera tradicional en tres actos. 
Renowned violinist ASIA (artist-in-residence at Cité des Arts in Paris
since 2023) received an exceptional musical education at the Royal
College of Music and the Guildhall School of Music and Drama in
London, supported by the Albert Cooper Trust and the Henry Wood Trust.
ASIA began her musical career at the age of four at the Conservatori del
Liceu de Barcelona, and graduated with the highest qualifications.

the Teatro La Fenice in Venice, the National Theatre in Shanghai, the
Wigmore Hall in London, the Palau de la Música in Barcelona, St. Martin
in The Fields London, Düsseldorf Cathedral, Opera Bastille in Paris, or
Buckingham Palace in London.
Asia regularly visited legend Ivry Gitlis in Paris, from whom he received
advice on many occasions. She was also able to learn from artists such
as Eberhard Feltz, Menahem Pressler and Nicholas Angelich, among
others.
Keen on interdisciplinary collaborations, Asia also develops her work in
composition during her Paris residency exploring the convergence of
classical and electronic music.

***Las imágenes médicas de radiografías, así como la historia de la columna son
verídicas; todas las imágenes son reales de mi tratamiento
El violín es el protagonista real.
Es un ser mágico, casi mitológico, de gran poder, que necesita de alguien que lo toque
para compartir su voz.
El violín llega a mi vida de muy pequeña, la conexión es inmediata, crecemos juntos. Su
poder es tan grande que, durante mis años de crecimiento, ejerce tal fuerza sobre mi que
mi columna vertebral se tuerce, sucumbe a su potencia.
Ahí la simbiosis es innegable, ligados para siempre. Diagnosticada a los 11 años, empiezo el tratamiento con corsé, a los 18 años la transformación está completa, mis huesos
encierran para siempre la forma que les ha dado el violín y los médicos se congratulan
(podría haber sido mucho peor, dicen).
La marca del violín me ha destrozado por dentro grabada a fuego nada menos que en mis
huesos, por otro lado, me regala una experiencia que es la de pasar y haber pasado miles
de horas los dos encerrados, yo por miedo a mostrar los hierros del corsé, él susurrándome las notas una tras otra. Me uno cada vez más al violín, que es quien me habla todo el
rato y con quién comparto todo lo que ocurre en mí.
X ray
Nuestra relación continua, en busca de una libertad más allá, intento negar nuestra relación solo para darme cuenta, una vez más, que mi libertad y la suya van de la mano, que
mi voz es su voz y viceversa, y que no hay mal en nuestra simbiosis sino complicidad.
Que los cambios en mi cuerpo son como las curvas de su madera, que es al vibrar juntos
que mis huesos quisieron formar parte de su estructura. Aún así su poder me transciende,
él nació 253 años antes que yo, y seguirá viviendo cuando yo ya no pueda tocarlo. Es la
aceptación de este estado de posesión la que permite ascender hacia otro plano, cerrando el ciclo y dejando atrás el exoesqueleto (corsé) que intentó encerrar y contener nuestra
historia de amor.

SINOPSIS
El violín cuenta una historia de doblegamiento y libertad en el cuadro
de la estructura de una ópera tradicional en tres actos.
TIMINGS SHOW
Overture (0 - 12)
Cuarteto (quizá con arpa) / clásico y composiciones mías. Overture es introducción
instrumental, presentación del violín y de mi. Mood música clásica aunque un poco rare.
ACT I (12 - 27)
Empieza la construcción del ‘corsé’ (a ver con LyS) - Mabel / Lolo y Sosaku
Mabel es mi yo interior, el que sufre los cambios que vemos en los x rays
En el acto 1 la infancia, la inocencia, pasajes preciosos de cuarteto con elementos ya de
máquina y elementos electrónica
Se enrarecerse la situación hacia el final del acto.
ACT II (27 - 50)
(CORE )
Aho Ssan composición conjunta
Cuarteto misma nota mantenida (posible) simboliza parálisis del clásico que lleva a -
transformación - TRANSMUTACIÓN
Lucha, miedo, rabia, amor, POSESIÓN, entrega, locura, gritos…
Arpa , voz, violin going crazy gritos coros
ACT III (51 - 57)
- El violín posee por completo a la niña y se produce una especie de ascensión (coro de
niños)
Coral preciosa y controvertida
Finalización de Mabel
‘Corsé’/máquina construido y terminado. ‘Monstruo’ completado. Pero la música va mas
allá acabando con la coral (pseudo-coral, una pequeña perla preciosa e inocente que es
en realidad el resumen de la fusión Asia con violín)
Mood animal herido, la locura del acto anterior todavía está presente, se va
desmembrando poco a poco hasta llegar a lo alto.
FIN
ESCENOGRAFIA
La idea es que la escenografía sea un decorado de ópera tradicional pero vivo. En
movimiento constante (detalles a precisar con Lolo y Sosaku)
Lolo y Sosaku como una especie de dios Vulcano cuando construye el trono. Detalles y
presupuesto a ver con ellos primero.
PERSONAJE CUERPO
Mabel, representa el yo interior y canaliza a través de los movimientos la relación Asia -
violín

His style combines intricate rhythms with industrial, techno, and techno-adjacent sounds, creating a dynamic and powerful energy in both his productions and live performances.', 'https://irjubpjnvgdhlyzigdpn.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/MySonar%20Videos//Blawan_live.mp4', 'UK', '18:00:00', '20:00:00', 'Through both time in the studio and time on the road, Jamie Roberts has dedicated
over a decade to developing his alias, Blawan. In the process, he’s created a universe
that’s all his own. Roberts grew up in Barnsley, UK and from an early age was etching
out his musical path as a drummer – a relic of the past which should come as no
surprise to anyone familiar with his productions. Indeed, his discography as Blawan
illuminates a natural fluency for rhythm, whether straight, stridently syncopated, or
swinging somewhere in between.
In 2021, Blawan debuted on XL Recordings with an EP titled, Woke Up Right Handed.
Upon release, the record caused ripples of excitement in the world of experimental
club music, going on to become a bonafide phenomenon and appearing in ‘Best Of
2021’ lists in RA, Crack Magazine, The Quietus, and more. Resident Advisor said of it
“Every Blawan record in recent memory has been eye-opening, but this one is blinding
in its brilliance, packaging everything great about each era of Blawan into five blissfully
bizarre tracks.”
This was followed by the EP Dismantled Into Juice in 2023, with its distorted drum
rhythms, piercing synths, unbelievable drums, and original vocal cuts that formed his
most riveting and genre-bending music to date.
In its wake, he has continued to bring his stunning Live and DJ shows to stages across

La seva música es caracteritza per l’ús de sintetitzadors modulats, paisatges sonors expansius i estructures harmòniques que evoquen una sensació de profunditat i moviment constant. Amb influències que van des del minimalisme clàssic fins a l’electrònica contemporània, construeix composicions que oscil·len entre la fredor analítica i l’emoció pura, generant atmosferes immersives i cinematogràfiques. La seva producció curosa, basada en una combinació d’instruments acústics i digitals, dona lloc a un so refinat i detallista, on cada element té un pes propi dins d’un flux hipnòtic i fluid. Amb un enfocament que beu tant de l’estructura melòdica com de la textura sonora, Grand River crea un univers musical introspectiu i expansiu que s’inscriu en la tradició de l’electrònica experimental més sofisticada.  

*Abul Mogard* és un artista enigmàtic que treballa amb la síntesi modular i el disseny sonor per crear paisatges ambientals densos i envoltants. La seva música es caracteritza per drones profunds, textures granuloses i una evolució sonora gradual que transmet una sensació de melancolia còsmica i introspecció. Amb un enfocament centrat en la repetició i la transformació progressiva del so, construeix atmosferes hipnòtiques que ressonen amb la física del paisatge industrial i la transcendència espiritual. Les seves composicions, sovint llargues i immersives, evoquen la bellesa de la degradació i el pas del temps, jugant amb la imperfecció i la saturació analògica per generar una calidesa sonora única. Amb influències que van des del drone fins al minimalisme electroacústic, Abul Mogard crea un espai sonor profundament evocador, on la textura i l’emoció es fonen en una experiència auditiva

A pioneer of Africa’s extreme music scene, his debut album The Adept (HAEKALU Records) earned praise from Pitchfork, BBC, The Fader, and more, positioning him as a global voice in heavy music. Known for his explosive live energy and unforgettable mosh-pit anthems at festivals like Sónar, Roskilde and Primavera Sound, Lord Spikeheart offers a cathartic, chaotic experience like no other. His latest track SILENCE in the C-DRAL, made with Italian producer Talpah, dives even deeper into metal and rap fusion. Over the past decade, Kenyan vocalist,
songwriter and producer Martin Kanja,
AKA Lord Spikeheart, has become a
figurehead of the African metal scene
cultivating a distinctive blend of guttural
growls pulled from the death metal
tradition, screeching screams and gravelly
rap verses that seep menacingly through
head-banging instrumentals.
His debut solo album ‘The Adept’, released
on his own label HAEKALU Records,
Africa's premiere label dedicated to darkest
and heaviest music from the Continent, has
acclaimed widespread recognition from
prestigious media outlets such as The
Guardian, BBC Radio, Pitchfork, Arte,
Dazed, The Fader, NTS, Crack, Resident
Advisor and The Quietus, — captivating
audiences globally from East Africa to the
rest of the world as a new frontier in
extreme music.
The list of collaborators is an inspired one — Cardopusher/Safety Trance, Fatboi Sharif, Brodinski, and
Backxwash are some of Kanja’s guests — but The Adept never feels like anything less than something only
Lord Spikeheart could have made.
It’s the sound of an atom of the soul being split, unleashing an eldritch new energy. - The Fader
Lord Spikeheart is also known for his captivating stage presence and high- energy live performances
breaking out into fun-filled mosh pits at some of the most prestigious festivals such as Primavera Sound,
Roskilde, Sónar, Le Guess Who? Roadburn to name a few. Attending a Lord Spikeheart show is a definite
must see. An electrifying experience evoking a strong sense of belonging and spreading fireballed
enthusiasm over the club.
Allow yourself to sit in this chaos and you may begin to feel strangely liberated, as if screaming into a raging
wind or, like Kanja himself, harnessing a prodigiously expressive power. - The Guardian
Kanja’s debut solo album surpasses the might of his past work by several degrees. Listening to it feels like
moshing in the Mariana Trench, being hurled by the currents through liquid darkness. - Pitchfork

Her powerful voice and poetic, socially engaged lyrics explore themes like collective memory and social transformation, offering a deeply evocative and forward-thinking musical experience. Maria Arnal fusiona la cançó d'arrel mediterrània amb l'experimentació sonora i l'electrònica, creant un estil que combina melodies i harmonies tradicionals amb textures digitals i samplers extrets d'arxius històrics. La seva música es caracteritza per una veu poderosa i emotiva, l'ús de ritmes i patrons inspirats en la tradició oral i una producció moderna que oscil·la entre la delicadesa acústica i la intensitat electrònica.

Born and raised in west suburban Chicagoland, Shaun J. Wright spent most of their teen years immersed in the sounds of house music. In the late 80’s and early 90’s, house music was a powerful force, permeating the mainstream airwaves of Chicago’s most prominent radio stations. With Wright being raised in the epicenter of house culture during this era, their love for dance music began to expand throughout their high school years as they partook in the underground dance scene now globally known as Juke. 
While in undergrad at Morehouse College in Atlanta, Wright developed their skills as a dancer in the vogue ballroom scene and professional dance companies.  After acquiring an MA Fashion Curation from the London College of Fashion, Wright enjoyed an active career in fashion in New York City. That is where they met Andrew Butler, founder of Hercules and Love Affair, in 2008, and began a whirlwind collaboration with the ensemble as a vocalist. They spent nearly three years touring with the outfit, performing in major venues & festivals throughout North & South America and Europe. They’re also featured prominently on the ensemble’s lauded sophomore album, “Blue Songs’. 
Returning to Chicago in 2012 to forge their solo career, Wright began to collaborate with respected DJ and producer Alinka. Promptly after beginning their party Twirl in the spring of 2013, Wright & Alinka released their first EP, Twirl Vol. 1, on the celebrated Classic Music Company led by luminaries Luke Solomon and Derrick Carter. They continued to expand upon the brand in late 2014 with their Twirl Records debut release “Journey Into The Deep” EP which included remixes from Kim Ann Foxman and Stereogamous. The label’s output has received much critical acclaim and has been supported by DJ Mag, XLR8R, Mixmag, BBC Radio 1’s Heidi and Annie Mac, and a plethora of notable DJ’s.  
Wright continues to collaborate with other sought after producers including Chrissy, Kiki, System Of Survival, Stereogamous Bell Boys, Bobmo, and Nicholas, and has been released on Freerange, BPitch Control, Honey Soundsystem & Cocktail D’Amore, Discovery, Marble, and 4Lux, respectively.

has led him to play in most of the clubs around the country.

His DJ style is like a coin. On one side, there's his club persona, the spontaneous and random side
where the dance floor takes the spotlight. You can catch him warming up a dance floor in the early
hours, getting it ready for the perfect temperature, to smashing it in the late hours. Always with a mix
of styles, from classic house and techno to new and psychedelic sounds, accompanied by a wide
range of UK music, and where any BPM is fair game.

On the flip side of the coin, there's the more methodical, calm, and sentimental face. Sessions are
handled with a specific and focused perspective, where, depending on the moment and place, you
might find anything from ambient and ethereal sounds to experimental music or genres that are
harder to categorize.

With the ability to blend the energetic with the serene, he reveals the complexity and richness of his
artistic expression

the machine is learning
performance (ca 20 minutes)
The performance the machine is learning is a theatrical performance highlighting the process
of training a machine with realtime gestures: the labour that is absent from most dialogues
on machine learning. In an attempt to livecode with gestures, the performer finds herself
directed by the machine to repetitively make gestures to generate time series data samples
for the machine to learn from.
Machine learning is both hailed as the solution to our current day problems, as well as
claimed as one of the most threatening things to life as we know it. The popular discussion
on AI criticizes issues of privacy with regard to data collection and the use of this data to
take decisions that affect the life of people in possibly negative ways. At the same time,
with the possibilities of AI further automating work, jobs are at danger and the fear is that
this will leave many without a job in the future. On the other hand, the labour involved in
making machine learning algorithms work, is less prominent in the popular discussion. The
labour involved in AI consists not only of designing and programming algorithms, but also in
generating and categorising these data samples. The working conditions of these tasks are
generally not known.

This performance evolved out of the development of GeCoLa during the MIMIC residency

Marije Baalman
biography
Marije Baalman is an artist and researcher/developer working in the field of interactive
sound and light art, based in Amsterdam. She makes music and music-theatre
performances, worked with dancers and has made several installations.
Topics that she addresses with her work are the nature of interaction between and
entanglement of humans and technology, the influence of algorithms on society and the
human experience, and environmental change.
In her artistic work she is interested in the realtime components of the work, composing
processes, behaviours and interaction modalities. This means that the sonic or visual output
depends on realtime interactions of the systems she builds with the performer, the
audience, or the environment.
This is expressed with tools such as physical computing (performance interfaces and/or
installations) and wireless systems, livecoding (both as a skill, as well as a performance
interface), digital and analog sound and data processing. In her work with light she uses
methods from sound composition and synthesis. To realise her works she mostly uses open
source technology (software and hardware) and she is an active contributor to the open
source community. In addition she has an interest in creating participative events and
environments, drawing inspiration from methods from the larp community in combination
with digital technology.
She also works as a cultural organiser and curator and as an activist to improve the rights of
artists and promote self-organised housing. She is a member of iii (instrument inventors
initiative) and Grond.
Marije Baalman has performed, exhibited and curated work across Europe (iii, V2_, Korzo,
Fiber Festival, STEIM, WORM (NL), EXIT festival (F), CTM (D), Make Art (FR), Electropixel
(FR), Today’s Art (NL), Artefact (BE), Nuit Blanche (FR)) and beyond (Electrofringe (AU),
Translife (CN), Elektra (CA), MAC (CA), Soulangh Cultural Park (TW)).
She has collaborated with various people, amongst which Ludmila Rodrigues, Matteo
Marangoni and Wen Chin Fu, Dieter Vandoren, Mariska de Groot, Alberto de Campo, Chris
Salter, Michael Schumacher, Attakkalari Dance Company and Workspace Unlimited.
Marije Baalman is a contributor to “The SuperCollider Book” (MIT Press, 2011 / 2025) and
in 2022 she publised a book titled: “Composing Interactions - An Artist’s Guide to Building
Expressive Interactive Systems” with V2_ in Rotterdam. She has been invited as keynote

visionary producer and co-founding member of Buraka Som
Sistema, and the mastermind behind the Enchufada label.
Recorded in Lisbon over a three-day jam session, where Branko
challenged some of the most critical Lisbon based musicians to
improvise over a rhytmic framework. This immersive experience
resulted in continuous hours of recording, forming a rich
repository of grooves that laid the foundation for the album's
beats. Soma embraces authenticity and genuine expression
through collaborations with both local and international talents.
Across the twelve tracks, the album features notable artists such
as Jay Prince from London, Angolan-Portuguese musician
Carla Prata, Cape Verdean American artist June Freedom, Rio
de Janeiro-based BIAB, Brazilian band Tuyo, London-based
Ghanaian rapper and vocalist Bryte, and Portuguese singers
Dino d’Santiago, Teresa Salgueiro, Carlão, as well as the
emerging local band Yeri & Yeni.
The concept behind Soma is rooted in the idea of plurality. To
celebrate the release there will be a three-day Soma House
program—a takeover designed to showcase the album's
creative journey. The inaugural live performance will be at
Sónar Lisboa on March 24th.
"I want to bring on stage what we
experienced in the studio during the recoding sessions,
” says
the artist who will be accompanied by the talented musicians
who took part in the iconic Namouche jam sessions in February
2023. The aim is to engage the audience and evoke the
essence of improvisation, where the collective synergy
transcends the sum of its parts.
Soma is set to be released on vinyl and digitally through

Project Description:  replica - relic is a live audiovisual performance by Iraqi-born transnational sound artist Dania and visual artist Mau Morgó.  Although decolonisation has become a cause célèbre throughout the Western cultural sphere, Replica - Relic questions institutions’ commitment to rectifying historical injustice. Focusing on the British Museum and its collection of antiquities—many of them “acquired” via colonial violence—the work not only rejects the museum’s custodial authority, but forcefully repatriates these objects.  Dania, without consent from the museum, visited the premises and surreptitiously took 3D scans of several Mesopotamian artefacts. Those scans then became the building blocks for a series of custom-built musical instruments which will be at the core of the replica - relic performance. Working in conjunction with Morgó’s immersive visuals, Dania will tap into the sonic memories embedded within these objects, reanimating voices and invoking the landscapes from which they came.  —————  Bio:  Dania Shihab (Baghdad, 1982) is a transnational artist, musician, curator and emergency doctor based in Barcelona.

Fafi Abdel Nour finds beauty in the margins and the bliss in between - a passionate artist and community builder, on a
mission towards imagining better futures through musical connectivity and understanding between humans.
Growing up as a first generation Syrian-born kid, the struggles of integrating into the Dutch society while balancing his Arabic
heritage and burgeoning queerness proved to be a struggle - often finding himself in between worlds, caught amidst
maintaining his inner pride and sense of self against a world that he strained to see himself in.
Through the desire to find harmony within a lifetime of dissonance, Fafi found dance music in his young adulthood. While his
connection to the music was powerful and provided a necessary level of personal reprieve, he soon realized there was a need
for more participation from artists and DJs of color in the scene. Fafi’s queer club nights at OOST in Groningen were born out
of this resolve to create community empowerment for marginalized people to transcend beyond the oppressive dominant
culture surrounding them.
As a DJ, Fafi never fails to captivate dancers into a sense of timelessness & otherworldly joy. His sets distill the liberatory
kinetics of house music down to its very essence, embodying an era of music unaffected by genre-constraints or rules.
Dissolving boundaries between sound, movement and being, dancers can expect everything from spellbinding melodic
passages, house-inflected body music and enchanted breakbeats melded into flourishes of ecstatic sensation.
Oscillating between jubilance and insight with a distinctive sense of narrative and technical finesse, Fafi’s selections expand the
universe of mystic, passionate and evocative strains of house - tapping into the source of music’s fundamental ability to
transform lives, through a deeply personal level of expression transmuted directly from his soul through the speakers.
Always encouraging us to connect with one another and celebrate the myriad of differences we share in our world, Fafi’s
vibration has radiated simply by embodying his truth and encouraging others to do the same for themselves. Currently based
in Amsterdam and with a slew of gigs only continuing to manifest throughout the world, his mantra remains the same no
matter where the music is played - Love is the message.
Jennifer Loveless is all heart and a force among the queer powers driving a particular moment in dance music
history.
The multidisciplinary artist’s creative outputs inhabit the full spectrum of emotion. They tip into the dualities and
subtleties that shape the human experience. Whether she’s producing music, DJing, scoring for screen, or writing top
lines, Loveless has a versatility that spans cheeky and deep, naughty and nice, delicate and driving. She ventures
into unexpected pockets of the zeitgeist to feed her own creativity. At once, Jennifer Loveless can tap at your
serotonin and pick at emotional scabs.
Dance drives her love of club music. JLO is just as comfortable on the dance floor as she is behind the decks which
creates an infectious energy and undeniable authenticity. Her emotive, body-pulsing, romping sets span the wide
gamut of house and shimmy into techno with a sense of warmth. Loveless adds colour and depth as elation and
nostalgia stitch her signature grooves together. This attitude has landed her nods for standout mixes on Truants,
Daisychain and Crack Magazine. As a producer, Loveless is a potent creator who’s dropped five releases within three years. With them, she is both
prolific and acclaimed. Whether it’s psychedelic house, raucous summer anthems, muted beats or heartfelt poems,
she’s consistently received ‘Best Of’ recognition across Resident Advisor, Bandcamp and Pitchfork. ‘Pleasure’ was
named as one Mixmag’s Best Tracks of the Year and she’s featured in RA’s Art of Production series and was listed as
one of The Guardian’s ‘Artists To Watch’. This recognition, coupled with releases and affiliations on striking labels like
Sex Tags UFO, Planet Euphorique, Butter Sessions, !K7, Future Classic and Miami Daddy, cement her as an
intuitive, yet technical producer.
Loveless has spent decades absorbing and living in various scenes around the globe from Canada to Australia and
has been Europe-based since 2021. Her eclectic musical background is what makes her just as skilful at playing
heady club nights in Panorama Bar and De School as she is working audiences at festivals like Horst or Pitch Music
& Arts. Loveless brings a sense of self-discovery, expansion and meticulousness to her craft leaving hearts and

The Talk is a live audiovisual performance by **Heith**, **James K**, and **Günseli Yalcinkaya**, merging experimental sound, voice, and immersive visuals to explore themes of language, perception, and communication.  

Heith, known for his genre-defying approach to sound design and ritualistic compositions, collaborates with James K, a vocalist and producer whose work blends ethereal melodies with fragmented electronic textures. Günseli Yalcinkaya, a writer and cultural researcher, brings a conceptual layer to the project, weaving narratives that interrogate how language shapes identity and meaning in an age of digital mediation.

currently based in Berlin. With a unique sound
that defies genre boundaries, Hello Sasy's selection is 100% focused on the dancefloor, featuring
selections of powerful bass-driven and techno
-influenced beats combined with warm sounds
and percussions that bridge her two cities.
Some of the venues where the artist has played
during her career are RSO, Oxi Club, Pacha Ibiza,
Razzmatazz, Apolo, or in radio stations such as
Rinse UK, Rinse France, HÖR, Refugee Worldwide Radio, Movement Athens or Dublab.
As a resident of the Mitmischen Berlin collective,
Hello Sasy's main goal is to create an immersive
dancefloor experience, breaking the stereotype
that electronic music is enjoyed in an individualistic way.
Sasy's set is guaranteed to make you dance and
sweat, with her dynamic and emotive sets, she

Known for his Fabric residency and debut album Poppa Zesque, he inspires freedom and creativity on and off the dancefloor.', 'https://irjubpjnvgdhlyzigdpn.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/MySonar%20Videos//Josh_Caffe_Live.mp4', 'UK', '20:00:00', '21:00:00', 'Josh Caffe has spent the last decade on a
breathless trip through the fringes of London’s
shifting house and techno continuum. As a DJ,
singer/songwriter, producer and activist of
British-Ugandan descent, Caffe’s influence has been
felt everywhere from institutions such as Panorama
bar and Adonis to his own Love Child party, curated
at Fabric, where Caffe holds an influential residency.
Collaborating with international icons of dance music and fashion such as Honey Dijon, he has become an even
more visible and respected presence in recent years. Recently delivering his debut album 'Poppa Zesque' on Erol
Alkan’s label Phantasy, Caffe has made his boldest statement yet. Two singles, ‘According To Jacqueline’ and ‘Do
You Wanna Take Me Home?’ (remixed by Steffi & Virginia) effortlessly captured Caffe’s vision of queer liberation
and sensuality.
Working alongside both Quinn Whalley of Paranoid London, for whom Caffe has provided memorable vocal turns,
and saxophonist Alex White of Fat White Family, Caffe’s solo material is charismatic, frenetic and rich in inspiration,
from classic Chicago house, UK acid culture, 00s rap and his twin heroes, Prince and Grace Jones. All of these
influences, be they sensual, jackin’ or sexually playful, echo through Caffe’s selections as a DJ. Mixes for Honey
Soundsystem, Beats In Space, Naive and Love International speak for Caffe’s standing in the queer and wider
dance music communities.
Having forged an intimate connection with dancers across the sphere of underground house and techno, whether

La tecnologia, i el seu sigil·lós impacte en les nostres vides més íntimes, és el centre de les seves pràctiques artístiques.

Hipnòtica, extática i amb la mirada posada en el futur, la visió de Juliana sobre el rave és, en part, una realitat paral·lela i, en part, una sessió col·lectiva. Short artist biography 
JULIANA HUXTABLE Shock Value / New York 
Using the structures of music as mediums in her multi-media universe, Juliana Huxtable is a DJ and musician singular in her approach. Where her visual art and poetry navigate the complexification of desire in a life increasingly mediated by technology, her music utilizes the sounds of technology itself to construct parallel realities to be inhabited and embodied in rhythm and harmonic tableaux. 
Her sets skillfully deploy the notion of sampling, and re-blogging as DJ strategies, ecstatically mixing an array of influences that frolic at the boundary of genre- intuition and experimentation. At once an assertion of freedom and an ode to the evolutionary structure of electronic music subcultures, she aspires to the sublime in what can often only be described as witchcraft behind the decks; seance from the stage.

Known for his genre-blurring sound, he played over 160 shows in 2023, including a residency at DC-10 and performances at major events like Coachella. With a deep passion for music and a fanbase of 3.5 million across socials, Mochakk blends influences from hip hop, funk, and grunge into his unique style. Committed to community and supporting Brazilian talent, his infectious energy and authenticity continue to make a lasting impact in dance music. Rising up out of Brazil's hotbed of formidable talent, Mochakk (AKA Pedro Maia) embodies a level of passion and drive that has placed him in a league of his own. His insatiable hunger for knowledge means he has a broad palette to draw from, channelling his deep well of influences into his vibrant creative output. As anyone who has witnessed him in action will attest, Pedro wears his heart on his sleeve, often expressing his honest love for music in an endearingly physical manner. His skills as a selector have led to bookings at globally renowned clubs, including a residency at the iconic DC-10, while his productions encapsulate his diverse sonic identity. Commanding the global stage with vigour, humour and his illuminating personality, Mochakk is laying down the foundations for an enduring legacy… 

Mochakk’s achievements in 2023 alone demonstrate how influential and respected he has become, with his online fanbase growing to over 3.5 million followers across his socials. He sold out a 5,000-capacity show for leading broadcaster Cercle at the Plaza de España in Seville (the set has almost 4 million views), played over 160 shows in 29 countries, and joined the family at DC-10 as a resident. On that note, Mochakk also released the huge single ‘Jealous’ with Circoloco Records, alongside his killer remixes of Groove Armada’s ‘Superstylin’’ and Diplo’s ‘Express Yourself’. 2023 also saw the launch of his Tricks And Tracks event series, merging his love of skateboarding with electronic music for a unique party. Elsewhere, his Mochakk Calling events have sold out at every worldwide location so far. At the end of 2023 he was named by both Amazon Music and Spotify Mint as Artist to Watch in 2024, wrapping up a hugely successful 2023 with the promise of an even bigger year ahead.

Going back to the beginning, Mochakk spent his formative years in Sorocaba, an hour and a half outside Sao Paulo. There he began to develop his identity through skating, with the influence of his parents’ artistic endeavours and love of music, also feeding into his persona. Both his mum and dad were (in his own words) music nerds, with disco, 80s hits, jazz, blues and rock, alongside Brazilian music, on rotation in the house. Driven by his innate curiosity, Mochakk began to search for the artists he heard being played at home, going down rabbit holes, from Pearl Jam, to “Top grunge bands” to learning what grunge music actually was, or from Linkin Park to hip hop. This early grounding in deep investigation and joining the dots between a myriad musical styles, is the essence of what Mochakk is all about. 

Through skating, hip hop was, of course, intrinsic to the soundtrack of Mochakk’s youth. He caught on to the connection between the funk and disco his mum loved, and the samples that were being used in hip hop. By 2012, his rapidly developing knowledge, and thirst for more, led to experimentation with the classic FL Studio. Being a fan of Guitar Hero, but with no hip hop alternative, he “gamified” production by trying to recreate parts of songs and tunes he liked. So began his route into beatmaking, which he still does now. 

Originally, Mochakk went to college to follow his mother’s footsteps into fashion, with music kept on the side as a hobby. But the music began to take over and he decided to leave fashion college to focus on gigs full time. Most pertinent to his growth as an artist was a chance meeting with a stranger who became a friend, and the first person to introduce Mochakk to DJing. Cesar was pivotal in Pedro’s route into the clubs, giving him the chance to learn how to beatmatch at his house and then inviting him in to play at his under-18s party “New Generation”. 

Here is where Mochakk’s stage persona developed. Far from being an performative, Instagram-driven display, he was translating a personal habit to the stage. It’s something he’s always done, with friends, or strangers, “Look, check out this part” while playing along with it. A trait that comes from his passion for the music and a background in breakdance, too - where dancers interpret the music in a very physical way. For Mochakk, this is all about respecting the music and bringing people’s attention to specific parts, with him simply the vehicle for it. This authentic response is deeply rooted, instinctive, vulnerable and only present in a small percentage of the time he is DJing. Most of the time, as he says, he’s just selecting and mixing. Ultimately, it’s the love for music, and the music itself, that prevails, with Mochakk establishing a solid rep for his selections. 

Driven by an abundance of knowledge, and still only in his early twenties, Mochakk has quickly established himself as a potent force from Brazil. With millions of fans across his socials worldwide, and plenty more on the dance floors, his vision is to use his growing platform to highlight other artists from his home nation, alongside the seemingly endless list of things that he loves. He wants to share his expansive world with his huge fanbase, in the hope that introducing them to the music, art and artists he loves will spark a movement. “If it's only me on top and nothing else is happening, it's not the top for me,” he says. “I'm more about seeing a whole movement going on”. This humble, community-focused outlook lies at the heart of what will be Mochakk’s legacy. “If somebody's got a cool brand that is based on something that matters, I want to see that grow. I want to help with that,” he adds. Like the social and political influence of bossa nova in the fifties and sixties, Mochakk wants to build something homegrown that will bring a positive influence to the world. 

Curiosity is often the key to making life interesting, and it’s something Mochakk has in plentiful supply. A natural born entertainer, who regularly devours music, history and cultural information by the truckload, he is a unique artist whose energy and enthusiasm are contagious. From his humble beginnings at New Generation to the big stage at Coachella, Mochakk keeps it 100 every single time, sharing music with thousands of fans in the most intimate and authentic way. And it’s that realness that will keep him performing at the highest level for many years to come… as long as he can bring everyone with him.

En només tres anys, ha trencat tots els motlles i ha passat de ser una artista emergent a consolidar-se al panorama musical. La seva música sexy i sensible ha connectat de ple amb la generació Z, gràcies a un reggaeton atrevit combinat amb música trista i tints dancehall, r&b i rap. Debutarà a Sónar d’una manera molt especial: presentant el seu àlbum debut NOVA BOSSA. Irma Farelo i Solé, artistically known as Mushkaa (Vilassar de Mar, 2004), is a Catalan singer who has made a name for herself in the Catalan urban music scene by dedicating her music to women, as a woman herself. Mushkaa defines her musical style as *"reggaeton porc i música tristoia"*, a mix of reggaeton, dancehall, contemporary R&B, and rap. However, within the urban genre, she considers her work to be *"nostalgic and sensitive."* She often writes about personal or close experiences and initially entered the music world as a form of self-therapy.  

She sings in Catalan, although she incorporates Spanish and English borrowings, which she attributes to the natural evolution of the language. In response to criticism—directed at her and fellow artists of her generation, such as Figa Flawas and The Tyets—she has defended herself by stating: *"Even though some may think we are ruining Catalan with Spanish influences, I believe we are actually helping to strengthen the language. That said, I don’t think it’s my responsibility as a 19-year-old girl to save Catalan. If we are in this situation, it’s because the previous generation didn’t do things right. We should appreciate that some of us are making music out of love for the language and for enjoyment, because it’s the language we think and speak in."*  

In her music videos, she is often seen wearing sportswear, a signature style she calls *"flow Mushkaa."* Her influences include Yung Beef, Albany, Soto Asa, and even indie music.

His debut album, Also This Will Change, won a Norwegian Grammy in 2020, solidifying his status as an innovative force in the scene.', 'https://irjubpjnvgdhlyzigdpn.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/MySonar%20Videos//Niilas.mp4', 'NO', '16:00:00', '18:00:00', 'Niilas is a composer, electronic music artist and dj from Norway/Sápmi. Weaving beats, deep
bass and melancholic melodies, he creates glittery textures of sound, all rooted in his
indigenous Sámi heritage and Arctic aesthetics. Elegantly navigating the borders between
house, techno and ambient, Niilas blends mood-rich soundscapes with energic beats, making
kaleidoscopic arrangements listeners can get lost in.
Growing up in the electronic music scene of the west coast city of Bergen, Norway, Niilas was
surrounded by a diverse range of influences, shaping his musical versatility. He earned a
Norwegian Grammy Award for his debut album Also This Will Change, establishing himself as
one of Norway's most exciting producers from a young age. On his latest solo album Rivers of

carefree and ironic lens inspired by queer culture. A fusion of music, dance, and unapologetic performance that could not be missed.', 'https://irjubpjnvgdhlyzigdpn.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/MySonar%20Videos//Ouineta.mp4', 'ES', '18:00:00', '20:00:00', 'Ouineta es la popstar definitiva. Su proyecto se concibe como una experiencia total,
inspirada en la cultura urbana y los iconos pop de finales de los 2000, desafiando
los límites de su propio imaginario a través de una mirada despreocupada e iróni-
ca. Rompiendo las normas del pop convencional, Ouineta es la fusión perfecta entre
música, danza y espectáculo, que con un guiño nos dice la verdad sin tapujos.
Su EP debut, Ouineta23, es un viaje a su adolescencia donde el deseo femenino, hac-
erse mayor, el amor y la identidad online son los protagonistas. Es como un final de
curso, lleno de nostalgia y frescura, donde realidad y fantasía se encuentran cara a
cara. Con más de 100.000 reproducciones combinadas en plataformas digitales, Ou-
ineta23 no solo captura la esencia de una generación, sino que establece las bases
de una sólida propuesta artística. Su último single, Bikini Kill, evoluciona hacia un
sonido más nocturno, revelando su capacidad para dominar cualquier escenario mu-

Their debut album Good Lies (2023) reached #11 in the UK charts. Praised by Thom Yorke, they’ve played major festivals and soundtracked Givenchy’s AW23 runway show.', 'https://irjubpjnvgdhlyzigdpn.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/MySonar%20Videos//Overmono.mp4', 'UK', '19:00:00', '20:00:00', 'Tom and Ed Russell are two brothers who grew up in rural South Wales, a cultural nowhere where you had to make your own fun. Through putting on parties in the back rooms of pubs and throwing free parties, the duo enjoyed their formative years away from the noise of the big cities, a freedom that shaped the sound of Overmono. By the time Ed was 16, the brothers were best friends and although they initially forged separate solo careers, they became frustrated with the limitations. They packed a car full of gear and hired a cottage in Wales, with no intention or agenda. The result of that trip was the birth of Overmono, a dance act with a debut record that has positioned them in the history of British electronic music alongside acts such as The Chemical Brothers and Burial.

The duo started dropping music through their own label Poly Kicks, and in 2020 they released a run of EPs on XL Recordings over a period of two years. These releases initially cemented Overmono’s position as fiercely innovative underground producers, receiving praise from artists like Thom Yorke, while their 2021 single “So U Kno” – awarded Track Of The Year by Resident Advisor – established them as the UK’s most exciting electronic artists. The singles released with their friend and British dance music pioneer Joy Orbison brought out the best sides of both acts, tunes that feel equally at home in a 200-capacity club or a main stage at Glastonbury. 
 
In 2023, Overmono released their long-awaited debut album, Good Lies to critical acclaim (“UK rave history is distilled to perfection” - The Guardian); it landed at #11 in the UK Charts and is widely regarded as one of the greatest electronic records produced in recent years. This was followed by two standalone singles - “Blow Out” and “Freedoom 2” (with Kwengface and Joy Orbison) - which have become celebrated club anthems on both sides of the Atlantic. The duo have had support from brands such as Burberry, Prada, Stone Island and they soundtracked Givenchy’s AW23 Womenswear Paris Fashion Week Show at the request of Creative Director, Matthew Williams. All the while, Overmono have evolved their audio-visual live show. Created with long-time collaborators William Aspden and Rollo Jackson, which has been awarded “Best Live Act” at the DJ Mag Best of British Awards and racked up millions of views via a unique Boiler Room from their takeover of Manchester’s Warehouse Project.

La seva música es caracteritza per paisatges sonors densos, ritmes fragmentats, glitches digitals i veus processades que es dilueixen en l’instrumental com una capa més de textura. Els seus temes evolucionen de manera orgànica, sense estructures tradicionals, combinant polirítmies erràtiques, atmosferes líquides i una producció que oscil·la entre el caos i l’ordre. Influenciat per artistes com Autechre, Aphex Twin, Oneohtrix Point Never i Arca, la seva obra també es complementa amb una forta dimensió visual i conceptual, fent ús de gràfics generatius, minimalisme digital i referències al ciberespai.

The second chapter to the work is jointly produced by Iranian-Canadian brothers Mohammad and Mehdi (Saint Abdullah), Irish sound-designer and musician Ian McDonnell (Eomac), and London-based Italo-Australian video artist and filmmaker Rebecca Salvadori. The project, entitled ’A Forbidden Distance’ is an exploration of the sense of self in relation to processes of displacement. Their collaborative audio-visual work reflects on the nature of stories and fragmented experiences, both collectively and individually.
 
 
“We were particularly excited to work with other festival curators directly on a collaborative project. Being able to benefit from the personal connections and experiences of other festivals added layers of depth and complexity to the types of performances we were able to create and made the process more fun and surprising.” Laurens & Harry - Curators for Berlin Atonal
 
“By joining forces, we can inspire each other to create solid artistic projects and delve into topics that are important to us and our audiences. Working together makes the curatorial process more interesting.

The undisputed icon of Generation Z will present her latest musical project on the Sonar Park stage on June 14th, delivering an electronic liturgy that will revisit all her classics as well as the repertoire of this upcoming LP, set to be released in the spring of 2025.

Música Para Muñecas is an irreverent proposal built around the life experiences of a gender dissident trying to make it in a big city.

Yerai Cortés is a flamenco guitarist from Alicante. He belongs to the new generation of artists who are taking flamenco to uncharted and exciting territories. Despite his youth (born in 1995), he already has an extensive career that has led him to collaborate with artists from various genres such as C. Tangana (whom he accompanied on his legendary tour "Sin cantar ni afinar"), Javier Colina, La Tana, Niño de Elche, Richard Bona, the emerging urban music star Judeline, and, of course, the great innovators of flamenco - both in guitar playing, singing, and dancing - including Rocío Molina, Rosario La Tremendita, Rycardo Moreno, and Manuel Liñán. These are just some milestones in a career that promises a fruitful future full of new goals.  

There are two stereotypes about flamenco that need to be dismantled. One is the idea that it is a pure genre - hence the purists who defend the orthodoxy of the style tooth and nail - when in reality it is a genre that was born mixed and has been subjected to continuous influences, impurities, heterodoxies, and twists and turns throughout its history. The other stereotype, derived from the previous one, suggests that, like blues, flamenco is a genre that does not evolve or evolves little. On the contrary, in recent years it has become one of the most malleable and renewed genres, and in reality, this evolution has always existed. Yerai Cortés arrives, precisely, to refute both stereotypes with his music, ready to redefine the boundaries of flamenco.

2008. She founds the "AV-Netwerk" collective between London, Berlin and
Venice, where she performs a five hours djset in Piazza San Marco. In 2013 in
Sicily she constitutes "il Vulcano", a cultural project directing music festivals
("Stereocybele" and "Capofaro Space & Sound", in the islands of Pantelleria and
Salina), and in 2016 she conducts a twelve hours radio show on the island of
Stromboli with the participation of Roberto Cacciapaglia and Gigi Masin and
presents "Paroxysm", an experimental live set based on volcanic field recordings
performed by Robert Lippok and Giuseppe Cordaro.
Her talent in the use of turntables brought her to play in museums and cultural
centres like ICA – Institute of Contemporary Arts in London, MACRO – Museo di
Arte Contemporanea Roma, PAC – Padiglione di Arte Contemporanea and Pirelli
Hangar Bicocca in Milano for the inauguration of XXI Esposizione Internazionale of
Triennale di Milano “21st Century Design After Design”. She consolidates her
work with Triennale playing sessions in front of 10.000 people for the 2017
Design Week Opening presenting the exclusive project “Italian Music. Antologia in
vinile a cura di Paquita Gordon” and for the 2018 edition with "Mar Mediterraneo.
Music and soundscapes by Paquita Gordon and Filippo Brancadoro on Tropic Disco
Sound System, with special percussive participation by Nino Errera".
She played at every edition of Terraforma Experimental and Sustainable Music
Festival at Villa Arconati, delivered great sets at Epizode (Phu Quoc, Vietnam) and
Dekmantel Festival (including a Boiler Room performance), played clubs like
Berghain Panorama Bar (Berlin), De School (Amsterdam) and Circoloco @ DC10
(Ibiza), participated at the David August international music tours in 2016 and
2018 and has a residency at Club Plastic Milano. In the summer of 2018 she
realised an exclusive mix for the renowned podcast series by Resident Advisor.
Her world has no borders, and the same goes for her music: a tireless traveller,
she gets new inspirations from all the places she visits. Her sets, all of them
entirely played on vinyl, can be divided through two main kinds, a cosmic one
and an earthly one.
The first category delves into the realms of psychedelia, black music, ambient,
dub, folk and spiritual jazz, creating something that is hard to define, personal
and unique, while the second one is linked with a 360^ club heritage, that goes
from house and techno to dnb and trance, with perfect and enthralling
mixes. Paquita’s musical research focuses on tribal aspects of sound, starting
from its origins and following these roots to their most contemporary
declinations, triggering a triumph of the ritual and collective dimension of the

Although Sama’ Abdulhadi is the first Palestinian DJ to gain international recognition,
her career really began when she left home for Beirut’s burgeoning techno scene.
Plunging into Lebanon’s nightlife, Abdulhadi gigged, practiced, and got inspired by the
many local and international DJs gigging on the scene, while refining her trademark set:
high-octane full-bodied techno with a distinct ark, a spectrum of moods, or as she says:
“Berlin techno, but I perceive it in a Lebanese way.”
Abdulhadi’s story begins in Ramallah, Palestine’s de facto capital. Moving there from
Jordan, her place of birth, she first connected with hip-hop and rap, the region’s
foremost alternative genre. A penchant for music was evident at an early age, but it was
the technical side that drew her in first, leading her to study in Beirut. She returned to
Palestine with a new understanding of electronic music, and brought with her the techno
genre, inspiring a local community of artists that continues to flourish in the face of the
geo-political restrictions imposed upon it as documented in the Boiler Room 4:3 short,
Palestine Underground.
Intent on pursuing a career in Music Production, Abdulhadi studied Audio Engineering
at SAE Institute London, the basis for two albums as Skywalker, her former alias, and a
job in Cairo, Egypt, where she began working with bands and designing sound for
moving picture, including Egyptian films like “The Builders” and “Thread and Wall.” It
was during this time in Egypt that Abdulhadi also trained with Oscar-winning sound
designer Nicolas Becker (Sound Of Metal), and later partnered with Arabic music
incubator Eka3 to start her own publishing agency, Awyav.
Beirut was both her training and testing ground, but she was back on home turf in
Ramallah when she played the 2018 Boiler Room debut that would make her a
household name among international techno fans. Her 58-minute set has over ten
million views to date, an achievement shared by a very small group of DJs, all the more
impressive for a Palestinian DJ who was virtually unknown outside the region when it
first broadcast.
The set was a window into the rare electric energy of Arab techno parties; the energy of
people living in the moment. Abdulhadi saw the same attitude in western audiences
after lockdown ended. She said in a recent interview with The Face: “It’s always been
like this in the Arab world. We don’t know what tomorrow holds so you feel this really
intense energy from the crowd. I love how parties and festivals can disconnect you from
reality. They can create this utopian bubble and just put you in a different world.”
Abdulhadi leverages her status as an international touring DJ to support the growing
number of musicians and creatives in Palestine in a number of ways. She has set up
Union, a collective in Ramallah that serves as a hub for DJs, producers and creatives of
all stripes to meet, collaborate and hone their craft together whilst also advising them on
the challenges they’ll face. In honour of the Boiler Room set hitting 10 million streams,
there was a re-sale of the highly-sought after Palestine t-shirt to raise money for the
Khalil Sakakini Cultural Center, Palestine’s leading arts and culture non-profit
organisation and a place very dear to Abdulhadi.
However, her efforts have not been without controversy. In 2020 during lockdown, she
was commissioned by online electronic music store Beatport to create a monthly music
stream to promote the country's heritage sites and emerging local talent. While
recording her stream in a bazaar near a mosque, she was illegally detained by
Palestinian authorities on December 27 and spent eight nights in jail, charged with
“desecrating a holy site” despite having a permit from the Ministry of Tourism.
Two days in detention, a judge ruled to extend her punishment by fifteen days, but she
only remained in custody for six more days thanks to a Change.org petition that
amassed over 101,000 signatures from the international DJ community. Pink Floyd’s
Roger Waters and political activist Angela Davis were among the signatories. On New
Year’s Day 2021, while still incarcerated, Abdulhadi released a Jane’s Addiction remix
with a vocal sample from Jim Morrison.
Her first full recording as Sama’ Abdulhadi came out in June 2021 on the new Circoloco
label / compilation in partnership with Rockstar Games. She also collaborated with
Rage Against The Machine legend Tom Morello, a frequent advocate of DJ culture and
solidarity with Palestine, on his album The Atlas Underground Fire. She is now working
on her debut EP slated for release early 2023.
Abdulhadi focus continues to be on the Middle East and through Bring Back Beirut, her
fundraise initiative for a liquidity crisis-afflicted Lebanon, she set up events in London,
Paris, Berlin and her “second home” Beirut. As part of the initiative, she released an
eclectic NFT compilation of Lebanese artists through Bolero Music in May 2022.
April 2023 saw Abdulhadi launch Resilience, a global platform for artists and creatives
to share their stories and artworks that depict experiences of marginalisation,
displacement and oppression. The platform aims to create a space for expression and
advocacy, where artists can tell their stories and amplify the voices of individuals and
communities often ignored in mainstream narratives. With the funds from the Bring Back
Beirut initiative, the platform will be launched in Beirut with a free party over two
consecutive nights (Abdulhadi bringing Richie Hawtin back to the city for the first time
since 2017) to raise money for the beleaguered people of Lebanon.
Abdulhadi now stands as one of the world's most exciting DJs (and fearless cultural
activists). She has played all over the world including Coachella, Glastonbury, Fusion,
Circoloco, Lost Village, Primavera and Belfast’s AVA festival, Brazil’s Warung and
Serbia’s Exit Festival legendary Dance Arena. Her close connection with Richie Hawtin
has seen her tour extensively across South America and likewise her 2019 b2b with
Lebanon’s Nicole Moudebar at IMS Dalt Vila In Ibiza holds huge significance. In
London, January 2023 saw Abdulhadi sell out the first 4 Friday’s with her own residency
at Phonox nightclub.
She has also done her first BBC Radio 1’s Essential Mix, significant for Abdulhadi as
the platform served as a source of huge inspiration for her whilst living in countries with
no international guests. Additionally, she contributed to BBC Radio 4’s Documentary:
'Techno: A Social History’ and graced the cover of DJ Mag UK and Resident Advisor.
A documentary film about Abdulhadi’s journey is currently being created by
highly-respected Middle Eastern producers & directors and will premiere in 2024.
Barely four years into her international career, Sama’ Abdulhadi’s story is at the
forefront of a powerful movement. Her goal has always been to put Palestine on the

Atonal, documenta fifteen, Ballroom Blitz Beirut, CTM Festival, Nyege Nyege
Festival, Ormside Projects, Dancity Festival, and Santarcangelo Festival.
She has collaborated with a diverse array of artists, including performing with Evelyn

London’s Southbank Centre, and working with artists like Elvin Brandhi, Andy Moor
(The Ex), Tony Elieh, Ludwig Wandinger, Dirar Kalash, Chrisman among others.
Sara's solo debut EP Boundary, was released in March 2023 on Karlrecords, and her
upcoming album is set to release in January 2025 on Subtext Recordings.
She is also among the artists selected by the Shape+ Platform, a European initiative
supporting innovative music and art, for 2023/24.
Mika Oki
Mika Oki is a visual artist, Dj and producer born in Paris
With a background in sculpture and electro-acoustic music, she explore the notion of
intangible spaces and emotional landscapes through AV installations, music and
mixes.
Like a sculptor who knows that the slightest miscalculated move of a chisel could
damage the totality of an artwork, Mika Oki’s selections elude great mastery and
undeniable preparation. Doing wonders in her many radio shows, it’s difficult to
realise her taste in rumbles and undeniable love for sounds from across the Channel
(drum and bass, UK garage, 2-step, grime…) before seeing her on the dancefloor.
Never hesitating to alternate a 90s dance anthem with an obscure juke track, she also
manages to gather seemingly disparate and conflicting elements together, creating an
incredible coherence. Percussive but generous, erudite yet uninhibited, she pieces
together unique mixes that never cease to surprise.
Eternal dreamer, she uses abstract sound textures and kinetic images to generate mind
trips, body journeys through music performances and immersive installations.
She also developed an interest in Djing in clubs and radio shows where she translate
her atmospherical experimentations, blurring The boundaries between techno, dub
and ambient/narrative sounds.
This year, she played in European audiovisual festivals like TodaysArt, SONICA,
CYNETART and in Uganda for the last Nyege Nyege festival.
She also exhibited her work “Reverse Osmosis” at Berlin Atonal 2018.
Her involvement in the electronic and experimental music scenes, and her desire to
highlight the Belgian artistic community led her to become station manager at The
Word Radio in Brussels.
Project description - Spahîra
Sara Persico and Mika Oki embarked on an adventurous audiovisual
collaboration inspired by the former’s forthcoming album, which features field
recordings from the experimental concrete theatre built by Brazilian architect
Oscar Niemeyer in Tripoli, northern Lebanon.
This impressive dome structure serves as a focal point where the sounds of
chaotic Tripoli echo alongside noises reminiscent of the underground or
underwater. Niemeyer envisioned the concrete theatre as a place of social and
political integration, open to all. However, Lebanon’s civil war left the site
abandoned, and it was later used as a barracks and staging ground for Syrian
Army forces.
Beneath Niemeyer’s concrete dome, militant groups allegedly conducted
executions and torture. Its exterior is scarred with bullet holes. The dome's
acoustics are a built-in feature: its shape creates a natural "whispering effect,"
allowing people standing at opposite ends to hear each other clearly at a
whisper, while shouting produces reverberating echoes.
The audiovisual interpretation of the album aims to recreate the dome's energy,
using dense light scenography and sound storytelling to transport the audience
inside the structure itself. Sphaîra is an immersive sensory experience designed
for deep contemplation. This audiovisual performance invites spectators to
embark on a mesmerizing journey, where the boundaries between external

Their music merges Mediterranean traditions with original compositions, exploring complexity through simplicity. Their latest album delves into tragic themes, combining voice, synthetic sounds, and samples.', 'https://irjubpjnvgdhlyzigdpn.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/MySonar%20Videos//Tarta_Relena_present_Es_pregunta.mp4', 'ES', '20:00:00', '22:00:00', 'Title: És pregunta
The project was born in 2016 by two singers who explore a cappella the sounds of the
different styles in vocal music. Tarta Relena wants to build a repertoire that goes from
traditional music to original songs that are related to the geographical area of the
Mediterranean. They do not fear to widen the limits of the sacred and the profane.
Experimentation is the core of their identity, and the blend of vocal techniques is their
creative engine. In the arrangements, the two very different timbres live together with the
synthetic sounds and electronic samples. Always looking for complexity in simplicity and
maximum expression with the minimum of elements.
Tarta Relena presents a new album that flirts with the notion of tragic thinking: diverse
characters who find themselves facing unstoppable consequences, known and unknown at
the same time. A conceptual mix of what fate has ready for us, our thirst for knowledge and
the inability to integrate future versions of ourselves. They try to capture in music and lyrics
the tension and mystery of what we do not understand, coming from logics that escape our
usual ways of existing.

Subscriu-te aquí a la newsletter de The Barbican per estar al corrent dels seus propers anuncis. A groundbreaking live collaboration between two titans of avant-garde electronic music.
Five-time Grammy award-nominated composer Suzanne Ciani & one of the most influential
contemporary electronic producers Darren J. Cunningham (Actress) come together for the premiere
performance of ‘Concrète Waves’ at The Barbican (London) and Sónar (Barcelona).
An unlikely pairing? Or a fascinating musical partnership?
For Ciani, her musical endeavors have largely been devoted to delivering more feminine sensibilities out
of the machines, in particular the Buchla, that underpin her practice. Time and time again, the ocean
has offered a rich metaphor for the feminine systems she is eager to encapsulate to her listeners, as
evidenced by her first commercial album ‘Seven Waves’ (1982). She fills space with swelling oceanic
soundwaves alongside synthesizer melodies and timbres. The result is deeply personal, almost spiritual,
and couched in a desire for connection and communication.
Ciani’s evocations of the natural world provide a stark counterpoint to Actress’ practice of ‘R&B’
Concrète. This unique methodology refers to the very foundations of his project and process that was
originally coined in response to Pierre Schaeffer’s Musique Concrète. Actress often pulls raw layers
and field recordings of urban cityscapes and the industrial backdrop of his home in the Midlands.
‘R&B’ Concrète allows Cunningham the ability to encompass the wider world of experimental and
populist music, whilst always positioned from the eerie lens of introversion and solitary meditation.
Where Actress & Ciani undoubtedly entwine is through total singularity in their respective sounds.
Throughout both of their careers, each have displayed an unrelenting desire to create unique musical
environments and forms around their projects that is unmatched by their contemporaries.
By harnessing the power of their similarities and differences, the artists will come together in a never
seen before collaboration. We will see how the juxtaposition of the natural and industrial world can
offer a space for sonic play that will be underpinned by the unconventional rhythmic framework of
Actress’ industrial practice ‘R&B’ Concrète via Ciani’s natural expressions on the Buchla.
The result?
A brand new boundary-pushing electronic performance that will creatively challenge the dense
conceptual framework of two of the most distinctive and inventive talents in electronic music,
presented in quadrophonic sound.

Actress (aka Darren J Cunningham) is a giant of electronic composition, a far-seeing philosopher-complicator whose explorations have prefigured and pioneered many of the great themes in the club since his acclaimed label debut Splazsh in 2010. Now 2024 marks the beginning of a new kosmische mood for his tenth album, and his first for Norwegian avantgarde label Smalltown Supersound.

Over the sweep of Darren’s career he has not only created his own arcane language, filled with hermetic references and interdimensional techno and electro but he arrived at many of the currents of the last twenty years first; often pushing out the waves and ripples of influence in his wake; from reimaging Stockhausen to collaborating with an AI trained on his own music as far back as 2018.

Actress’s first love growing up in the post-industrial Midlands was football. It was a career-ending injury that while he was playing in the West Bromwich Albion youth team that was music’s good fortune, forcing a change in professional trajectory. Drawn to visual art, his other favourite was clarinet, classical training that he would use later in his career. A devotee of Detroit techno and particularly, Derrick May, Carl Craig and Kevin Saunderson, Cunningham, had the good fortune to have a friend sell him a studio setup for £200.

After moving to London, Actress funded his degree in Recording Arts with a grant from the Professional Footballers Association for young players whose careers had been finished by injury. The result was a complete submersion in the dance subcultures of the capital. Founding his own label Werk Discs for his debut album Hazyville, he emerged seemingly pushing back against demarking lines, never using a metronome or the grid within the work.

Werk Discs had been spun out of a club night founded by Darren and friends. The label went on to release the most vital  producers of the late 00s; Lone, Helena Hauff, Zomby, Lukid. Cunningham’s second album in 2010 Splazsh represented a breakthrough, topping The Wire’s Rewind Albums of the year list and later being added to Pitchfork’s Top 100 Albums of 2010s. Released on Honest Jon’s, a label jointly founded by Damon Albarn, Actress travelled to the Democratic Republic of Congo to record a track for Albarn’s Kinshasa One Two album.

Actress’ third record R.I.P. was inspired by Milton’s poem Paradise Lost and was hailed as a masterpiece, seeing a significant musical shift towards a meditative 21st century rewiring of mid-century classical that would indicate his creative direction. In 2013, he formed the Werkhaus creative group to produce a show with artists Eddie Peake and Nic Hamilton at St John’s Church Hackney, a one off performance titled A shared cultural memory. His fourth LP in 2014 titled Ghettoville saw the shift to a darker atmosphere, with many fearing the end of his recording work, with the album self-described as the "black tinted conclusion of the Actress image". That was proven to be a misunderstanding of the intention of the text, as he followed up with an instalment of the DJ-Kicks mix series in 2015. His next move in 2017 was the afrofuturist AZD themed around chrome and inspired by art like Anish Kapoor’s Cloud Gate, outsider artist James Hampton and hip-hop pioneer Rammellzee. Pronounced “AZID,” the title was an anagram of his nickname, Daz. 

Also in 2017 he worked with Sandunes, Jack Barnett (These New Puritans), percussionist Jivraj Singh and vocalist Priya Purushothaman to respond to Steve Reich’s seminal piece Different Trains. They delivered a series of audiovisual events, culminating in a performance at a festival on the edge of the desert in Rajasthan.

The 2018’s LAGEOS album was made with the London Contemporary Orchestra and originally performed at a legendary sell out concert at the high temple of British brutalism, the Barbican. The record was an experiment in forming synergy between electronic machine and acoustic elements. Greek composer and architect Iannis Xenakis was a reference - they took inspiration from the architectural layouts of the Barbican for the score. In 2019, he returned to the classical world and the Royal Festival Hall on the Southbank, performing his reimagining of Stockhausen - titled Sin (x) II. The piece was based on the opening scene of the opera Mittwoch Aus Licht - called Welt-Parlament. Mittwoch was just one opera in seven of Stockhausen’s 29-hour Licht cycle - composed over 26 years. Actress had knowingly taken on one of the most difficult and controversial composers of the century. 2018 also saw him preshadow our 2024 discourse about machine intelligences, when he revealed the Young Paint project - an EP made by an AI trained on his own earlier work “progressively emulating the Greyscale to Silvertone process Darren J. Cunningham started during the recording of the Hazyville LP”. Using the freedom of the underground pseudonym he has also released music under the aliases Bank Of England, GNESIS, THAT KNIGHTSBRIDGE OG, DIAL 666 8100 - and maybe more.

2020’s critically acclaimed Karma & Desire followed, featuring Mercury Prize winner Sampha, Zsela, Aura T-09 and “a broken romance espionage ethereal short film” by creative director and performance artist Lee Nachum aka Bootee featuring cameos from Zsela, Yves Tumor, Sampha, Aura T-09 and Actress. Last year saw LXXXVIII (88, a reference to the artist's numerological beliefs) and its inspiration in game theory and chess released to further acclaim. Whether inspired by warehouse raves, Stockhausen or sci-fi, Actress has left a body of work that stands as like an inscrutable monolith, replete with secrets of the far future.

The calm, meditative, infinite vistas of the new record Statik were foreshadowed with Actress’ first release with Smalltown, a rare remix in 2022 of the label’s Norwegian-Mexican atmospheric Fourth World world weaver Carmen Villain. Combined with photos and art from Norwegian photographer based in Paris Ola Rindal, Statik presents a dreamlike progression in Darren work; infinitely deep loops of fractal thoughts, with a levity and flow, a master at work. Ola represents the latest collaborative partner in a career filled with them; from performance shows with White Cube artist Eddie Peake, being the subject of work by Belgian visual artist Pierre Debusschere, a single with Mercury Prize winner Sampha to being photographed by Turner Prize winner Wolfgang Tillmans and having fronted campaigns for Acne and Cav Empt.

A poetic dialogue between past and future, shaped by two masters of sonic minimalism.
Vienna/Berlin, April 12, 2024* – Christian Fennesz from Vienna and Alva Noto from Berlin, two renowned musicians in their own right, are set to embark on a groundbreaking collaboration in honor of the late Ryuchi Sakamoto. Titled "Continuum," this special performance will pay homage to Sakamoto's legacy while pushing the boundaries of musical innovation.

The collaboration between Fennesz and Alva Noto was born out of a shared admiration for Sakamoto's work and a desire to carry forward his spirit of collaboration. Drawing inspiration from the past, the two artists have joined forces to create a seamless continuum of music that bridges the gap between generations.

"Continuum" will not only showcase the musical talents of  Fennesz and Alva Noto but will also highlight the collaborative efforts of a dedicated team. From technical directors to sound managers, stage and light designers, and video specialists, every member of the team has come together to ensure a memorable and immersive experience for the audience.

"We are very happy that the team is back together," says Fennesz. "Of course, we were missing Ryuchi, and we will try to fill this gap in order to continue his legacy and create new inspiring music."

In recent times, the forest has become a contentious place, initially due to logging, however since late 2021, scores of migrants from Africa, the Middle East and South Asia have attempted to go through the forest and cross from Belarus into Poland and the European Union. Many have either died within the forest during this journey, or they’ve been pushed back by Polish guards. Additionally, a metal wall has been constructed to divide the forest, which has become a symbol of wider geopolitical tensions. This intense location provides the grounding for Białowieża, in which the natural and unnatural sounds of the forest have taken on additional layers of meaning.
‘Białowieża’ 
Chris Watson & Izabela Dłużyk
 
The Białowieża Forest, a site of exceptional natural beauty that has become the symbol of wider geopolitical tensions
 
One such site identified by the four commissioning festivals is Białowieża Forest, which stretches across Poland and Belarus. It is the last mainland part of the primeval forest that once stretched across Europe and is still largely untouched by humans. 

For more than two years, migrants from the Middle East, Africa and South Asia have attempted to cross through this forest into Poland and the EU – and have been pushed back by Polish guards. This has resulted in migrants being trapped and dying. A metal 
wall has been constructed, dividing the forest, which has become a symbol of wider geopolitical tensions. 
 Field recording in total darkness
 
This site provides the geographical grounding for the first chapter of this project, called ‘Białowieża’. This sonic experience is a work by the legendary field recordist Chris Watson, who is working with Izabela Dłużyk, a blind Polish sound recordist celebrated for her profound connection to nature’s acoustics and recognized as one of the BBC's 100 Most Influential Women in 2023 for her expertise in bird sound recording.

single “Fallen” to perform music from their forthcoming album – an irresistibly soulful, elastic
collaboration between two of the UK’s most forward-thinking musicians. The album orbits
around Herbert’s fleet-footed productions, matched by the ingenuity of Momoko Gill’s
melodic playing, as she moves between drum kit, samplers and microphone. Lifted to higher
realms by Gill’s intimate vocals, the duo’s propulsive, syncopated compositions are at once
reminiscent of Herbert’s iconic album Around the House, while taking off in a compelling new
direction altogether. Lush, expansive, and with a shared passion for unique sonics – from

house, soul, and disco, with groove-laden percussion, modern club sounds, and
touches of breaks and syncopated rhythms, always delivering a bold, surprising, and
radiant musical experience.

boundaries and redefine the city’s clubbing culture, hosting renowned artists such as
Roza T erenzi, Cinthie, and Marie Montexier, among others. With an absolute
commitment – mind, body, and soul – to her art, her sets are true “uplifting dance

producer, DJ, sound designer, and label founder best known for his work as
Shapednoise. He sculpts perplexing, mangled electronic textures, fusing
them with abrasive, expertly designed rhythms and crashing across genre
boundaries, pulling inspiration from industrial music, hardcore continuum,
experimental noise, hip-hop, and rap.
Pedone’s idiosyncratic technique has evolved across four vastly different
releases: 2013’s Opal Tapes-released “Until Human Wakes Us’, “Different
Selves” released on Type in 2015, 2019’s “Aesthesis” on Scottish imprint
Numbers and “Absurd Matter, the inaugural release on his multidisciplinary
platform WEIGHT LOOMING. The latter is Pedone’s most ambitious full-
length to date, structuring his ear-bending sonic experimentation into unstable
but familiar patterns and featuring guest spots from NY rap duo Armand
Hammer, techno-rap trailblazer French producer Brodinski, David Lynch-
collaborator Dean Hurley, vanguard Philly poet, musician, and activist Moor
Mother, and Bruiser Brigade’s ZelooperZ.
“Absurd Matter” is accompanied by an a/v live show in collaboration with
Barcelona-based producer and visual artist Sevi Iko Dømochevsky,
transitioned from the VFX and gaming industries to electronic music,
collaborating with artists such as Skrillex, Arca, and Grimes. The visual aspect
of this live will showcase a delirious and schizoid pseudo narrative CGI
adventure based in a sewer world whole of nightmarish entities and very
experimental and deep-fried energy to it—tons of chaotic and explosive 3D
visuals with a twisted sense of humor.
At Sonar 2025, they will premiere an evolution of their A/V show, including
new visual aspects and music from the new album“Absurd Matter 2,” set to be
released in the summer of 2025.
In the sight of “Absurd Matter”, Shapednoise, has been featured on:
Bandcamp
“The sheer sonic power that is imbued on every track demonstrateshow
the Italian consolidated his trauma: by lacing his music with unpredictable
freneticism.”
BBC Radio 6 Music
“The resulting things are pretty powerful and pretty impactful.”
Resident Advisor
“At times, Absurd Matter is brilliant; elsewhere, it sounds like it mightcombust
into flames at any second. Sharp, industrious, dissonant, ambitious—with
Shapednoise, it's best to expect the unexpected.”
The Guardian
“One of the heaviest rap productions imaginable.
The Fader
“Sicilian producer Shapednoise delivered some of the most hellishsound
design in rap this year.”
The Quietus
“The record’s true success is in how it contorts the familiar shapes ofclub
music, like techno, grime and especially hip-hop.”
The Wire

Together we develop
interactive installations that use digital technology to explore organic interactions in order to
expand ecological sensitivity and rethink coexistence beyond anthropocentric perspectives.
We began our artistic research in 2019 with the question: “How can “nature” be integrated in
an increasingly digitalized era?” This initiation led us to develop our practice within the
realms of art, science, and digital technology. By 2023, this reflection expanded to: “How can
we imagine a future limited by a lack of vocabulary?” This expansion reflects a deeper
concern about how language shapes our ability to visualize and communicate present and
possible futures. Over the past few years, our exploration of digital technology as a tool to
amplify the ability to listen has led to a series of works and processes that seek a deep
engagement with our own internal systems. This process invited us to open a dialogue with
the attention we dedicate to our own bodies, perceptions, and emotions. How can I listen to
other forms of life if I have not yet learned to listen to myself? Understanding “nature” implies
accepting that not everything can or should be understood, this understanding begins with
listening, and inclusion in the processes of observation. From this perspective, we find
resonance in interpreting the elements – water, earth, fire and air – that allow us to ground
ourselves in the poetic interpretation of the environment. Our research explores how

Chano Domínguez & Bronquio present ‘Calle Barcelona’


"Calle Barcelona" es el nombre de la calle donde vivió Paco de Lucía de niño en Algeciras y el título del estreno de una nueva producción que une al célebre pianista de flamenco-jazz Chano Domínguez y el innovador productor Bronquio. Traen al Sónar los sonidos de uno de los mayores exponentes de la música contemporánea con un viaje sonoro que transforma y reinventa raíces del flamenco y explora nuevas texturas y ritmos con la electrónica.

Acompañados por artistas de la nueva generación de Taller de Músics, Chano Domínguez y Bronquio  presentarán en directo un encuentro donde cada acorde y cada beat cuentan una historia basada en la de Paco. Con el uso de tecnologías avanzadas y gran variedad de timbres, esta obra busca no solo rendir tributo a Paco de Lucía y su obra, sino también abrir un diálogo entre tradiciones y estilos de sus creadores.

The Drum and The Bird is a collaborative project between Forensis, an experimental platform exploring the intersections of sound, research, and political forensics, and Bill Kouligas, an artist, composer, and founder of the influential PAN label. This project merges investigative sound practices with avant-garde electronic composition to examine the relationship between rhythm, language, and environmental acoustics.

Through a combination of field recordings, digital synthesis, and conceptual sound design, The Drum and The Bird navigates the tensions between natural and artificial sonic ecologies. The work engages with forensic methodologies, uncovering hidden narratives within soundscapes while questioning how rhythm functions as both a communicative tool and a means of sonic resistance.

electrònica experimental, pop digital i post-club amb una estètica crua i emocionalment intensa. La seva música es construeix a partir de veus processades, sintetitzadors eteris i percussions trencades, creant un so fragmentat però profundament evocador. Amb influències que van des de l’hiperpop fins a l’avantguarda sonora, juga amb la distorsió, l’autotune extrem i atmosferes digitals que oscil·len entre la vulnerabilitat i l’agressivitat. Les seves lletres, sovint introspectives i abstractes, es fonen amb produccions carregades de textures glitch i reverberacions expansives, transportant l’oient a un espai sonor líquid i mutant. Amb una estètica post-internet i un enfocament radicalment emocional, Nina Emocional redefineix els límits de la música electrònica, creant un univers sonor on la sensibilitat i l’experimentació es

experimentation with digital neural networks and the human voice.

This work confronts two opposing approaches: music produced organically and music generated digitally using IRCAM’s RAVE neural network.

Safety Trance has spent the last decade touring and creating a wide variety of noisy
dancefloor assaults under his Cardopusher alias. Growing up in Caracas during the
'80s/'90s, the Latin hemisphere made a big impact on his musical formation which
can be noticeable in most of his work. Although he started in the breakcore/rave
scene, he’s slowly gravitated toward a raw take on EBM that is no less compelling.
As Safety Trance, Garbán is looking to explore different genres and sonic
capabilities not necessarily linked to his usual dancefloor output as Cardopusher. His
first notable work under this new alias can be heard on Arca´s KiCk series for XL
Recordings (co-producing/writing the singles Prada, Rakata, Tiro, Queer and KLK ft.

La suavidad y
ligereza del pop siempre se adelanta en sus temas, por su
voz dilatada y esponjosa. Luego ella, a nivel compositivo,
recuerda muchas veces a una organista alocada y eléctrica
de una parroquia, escondida en algún callejón de alguna
ciudad con intramuros, anacrónica y discotequera. Lo cierto
es que Sofia suena a Sofia, y cuando uno suena a uno es
harto difícil catalogar.
Así, cuando esta mallorquina afincada
en Valencia compone desde su autenticidad única, genera
paisajes concretos a los que sólo puedes acceder a través de
ella, imposibles de otro modo.
Este año regresa con
‘Canciones para saltarse por encima’, un LP en el que
variante y disléxica, descoyuntada y ágil, se atreve a la
inmediatez y a la autocombustión espontánea de manera
grácil y divertida. Sus temas encuentran siempre la manera

years old, TRISTÁN has emerged as one of the most intriguing talents in
Madrid's music scene. As a member of the Rusia-IDK collective (home to artists like
Ralphie Choo and Rusowsky), this young producer-singer brings a unique and enigmatic
touch to the label, exploring melancholy and emotional depth through forward-thinking
R&B cuts.
Over the past year, TRISTÁN has showcased his versatility as a producer, collaborating
with prominent artists such as Babymarocco and the internationally acclaimed Nathy
Peluso, solidifying his position as a key figure in contemporary music production. Now,
he’s ready to take his own artistry to the next level.
Before the summer of 2025, TRISTÁN will release his highly anticipated debut album,
where organic music takes center stage, seamlessly blended with electronic elements to
create a fresh and personal sound. The album will feature collaborations with standout
artists like Rusowsky and Calcutta, among others, promising a sonic journey that fuses
innovation with heartfelt emotion.
As a producer, singer, and creator, TRISTÁN is carving a unique path, positioning
himself as one of the most promising artists of his generation. Backed by Rusia-IDK and

 Hyporeal is the first large scale solo work by Ville Haimala, also known as one of the founding
 members of Amnesia Scanner.
Ville Haimala, is best known as one half of Amnesia Scanner the Berlin-based group he started with Martti Kalliala. Founded in 2014, the group’s scope encompasses music writing, production
and performance as well as its creative staging and circulation. AS has become known for theirm genre-generating inventiveness. This influencing-the-influencers position has solidified their status as a must-have electronic festival act, often headlining with a new stage production using
 novel technology such as animatronics or audience participation via airdrop. In releasing music,
 AS has taken divergent approaches using bleeding edge developments in art and aesthetics to serve an overarching narrative.
 Independently, Haimala frequently collaborates with visual and performance artists such as
 Anne Imhof whose grand scale performances in Tate Modern, Palais De Tokyo and Park

As the creator of the "Desculonización" movement, she challenges norms with experimental, high-energy performances.', 'https://irjubpjnvgdhlyzigdpn.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/MySonar%20Videos//KEBRA.mp4', 'BR/MX', '16:00:00', '18:00:00', 'KEBRA is a DJ and multi-artist hailing from Uruana-Goiás-Brazil, based in Mexico City.
Rising icon of the Mexican electronic scene, KEBRA has been gaining an important place by
opening fissures in streets, museums and niche parties in the country and around the
continent. Also known for being the creator of the Latin American and insubmissive
movement “Desculonización”, sweat is her mark of liberation. As a DJ, she has developed her own style by mixing a dense exploration of electronic
sounds from the global underground, which has given her a unique, unscrupulous style,
always infused by the fervor of Baile Funk, Dembow, and other rhythms from a wide range of
club influences within the Latin diaspora, electronic music and beyond. In her sets, she
experiments with overlays, textures and BPMs, fearlessly playing between sensations and
leading the audience to risk from furious dances to dissociative moments on the dancefloor. KEBRA has worked as a performance and music curator in international festivals and has
exhibited her work in multiple exhibitions and artistic residencies. Although her career as a
DJ is young, she has shared line up in venues such as Razzmatazz (Barcelona), Bilbao BBK

It was founded in 2017 as a research project in AI and music based at the National University of Tres de Febrero in Buenos Aires with the goal of developing an experimental sound platform that is now a pioneer in the intersection of AI and sound. Following this development, its consolidation, and dissemination at national and international festivals and conferences, the team expanded to seven members from diverse disciplines and decided to focus primarily on artistic production, exploring the software created no longer from a technical curiosity, but rather producing audiovisual narratives with a poetic discourse and conceptual evolution, fictions and experiences that bring us closer to understanding the device and its operation on reality. In this way, we create transdisciplinary installations and performances that combine music, visuals, and dance.
We are developing a transdisciplinary performance conference that combines sound art, visuals, and dance. We will use body tracking technologies where performers will perform movements that interact with the sound map generated by our AI and execute sound textures that emerge from gestures and poses. In this way, it is the dance that musicalizes the experience, challenging the traditional place of sound. We will work with sound recordings linked to intimacy: minimal sounds that reflect an everyday life that operates underground. The AI ​​listens to these recordings, cuts them, and generates a sound map with which to interact. We propose a triangular dialogue between human listening, machine listening, and the performer as intermediary.
The cast of dancers provide the choreographic direction, drawing on research linked to contemporary dance, Butoh, Contact, Flying Low, and improv.
Our works have different sections, where we seek a balance between educational strategies so that the audience understands the tracking technique we propose while also ensuring improvisation,

SYNAPTICON is a radical experimentation that merges neuro-hacking,
brain-computer interfaces (BCI), and synthetic intelligence to
explore new realms of human expression, aesthetics and
surveillance. This innovative framework envisions a new era of the
“Panopticon”, where cognitive and algorithmic systems converge,
authorizing real-time monitoring, modulation, and prediction of
thought, behavior, and creativity. Through the use of BCIs and
SOTA AI-driven cognitive models and architectures, SYNAPTICON
blurs the boundaries between the self and surveillance, offering
profound insights into the neural and algorithmic fabric of
perception within human existence. By developing a real-time
“Brain Waves-to-Natural Language-to-Aesthetics” system, SYNAPTICON
first translates neural states into decoded speech and then into
powerful audiovisual expressions for altered perception. This
visionary project proposes a new genre of performance art that
invites audiences to directly engage with Albert.DATA’s mind,

Conceived by artists Julieta Wibel and Mike Fernández, this project will be presented at Sónar 2025, where it will materialize through an informative talk and an immersive installation that will give tangible form to its conceptual discourse. Math Thrash is based on a mathematical and technological structure where complexity is not an obstacle, but a vehicle for immersion and innovation. Far from generating barriers, structural precision and rigor enhance the experience, transforming the seemingly unattainable into a dynamic and accessible system. Thrash and Trash share a disruptive essence: the former, through aggressiveness and speed, breaks down structures to reformulate them with mathematical precision; the latter, from the discarded and the chaotic, generates new realities by transforming the corrupt and distorted into a language of its own.
Julieta Wibel, multidisciplinary artist, creative director, and performer
art, technology, and fashion
She has developed innovative projects, such as her intervention at the Thyssen Museum,
where she combined augmented reality, video art, and performance fashion, exploring
new narratives in contemporary art. Her social media presence functions as an
expanding museum, where each image and video reinforces her artistic identity.
is one that
fuses without restrictions. Her work challenges the boundaries between the
physical and the digital, the conceptual and the viral, turning each piece into an
immersive experience, thanks to her training in Industrial Design Engineering and Video Art.
She has collaborated with brands and spaces such as Diesel, Sony Music, Warner Music, Vogue,
La Casa Encendida, and Netflix, establishing her own visual language that transcends
disciplines. Her work is not only created, it is inhabited and experienced, consolidating her status as

### Long Description of "Aquelarre Futurista"
Imagine "Aquelarre Futurista" as a visionary reworking of Francisco Goya’s haunting depictions of a witches' sabbath, infused with the dynamism, technological fervor, and revolutionary spirit of Futurism. Goya’s original "El Aquelarre" (1798), a small oil painting, portrays a coven of witches—young and old—gathered around a towering, horned he-goat, a manifestation of Satan, under a moonlit sky. The scene is steeped in superstition, dread, and the grotesque, with nocturnal creatures like bats flitting above and emaciated infants offered to the demon. In contrast, his later "Witches' Sabbath" (1821-1823), part of the Black Paintings, amplifies this darkness with a larger, more oppressive composition, reflecting Goya’s disillusionment and mental anguish. "Aquelarre Futurista" takes these roots and catapults them into a radical, machine-driven reimagination.

In this futuristic rendition, the he-goat is no longer a static, medieval symbol of evil but a mechanized colossus—a towering automaton of gleaming steel and whirring gears, its horns crackling with electric arcs, a fusion of nature and technology. The witches are transformed into a collective of avant-garde rebels, their tattered robes replaced with sleek, metallic garments that shimmer with neon accents. They are not bound by superstition but are agents of chaos and progress, wielding tools of modernity—arc welders, sonic amplifiers, and flickering holographic incantations. The barren, moonlit landscape evolves into a pulsating urban sprawl, its skyline jagged with skyscrapers and streaked with the trails of roaring automobiles and biplanes, embodying the futurist obsession with speed and urbanity. The night sky hums with energy, illuminated not just by the moon but by the strobe of searchlights and the fiery exhaust of machinery in motion.

The composition itself breaks from Goya’s static, centralized focus. Inspired by Futurist techniques, the figures multiply and blur, their forms repeated in staccato bursts to suggest movement—witches spiraling around the mechanized goat in a frenzied dance, their limbs streaking like the lines of Giacomo Balla’s paintings. Colors explode in vibrant primaries—reds, yellows, and blues—clashing with the somber blacks and browns of Goya’s palette, symbolizing a rejection of the past’s gloom for the vivid chaos of the future. The infants, once victims, are reimagined as synthetic beings, half-human, half-machine, offered not as sacrifices but as prototypes of a new race born from technological alchemy. The soundscape, if audible, would be a cacophony of industrial clamor—grinding metal, revving engines, and the shrieks of amplified voices—echoing Luigi Russolo’s "The Art of Noises."

Thematically, "Aquelarre Futurista" merges Goya’s critique of human folly and superstition with Futurism’s exaltation of modernity and violence. It becomes a satire not of witches, but of a society enthralled by its own inventions, where the demonic is no longer supernatural but mechanical—a god of progress presiding over a sabbath of innovation gone wild. It retains Goya’s sense of unease but channels it into a celebration of disruption, aligning with Filippo Tommaso Marinetti’s call to burn the museums and embrace the "beauty of speed."

### Biography of "Aquelarre Futurista"
Let’s construct a fictional "biography" for this concept as if it were an artwork or movement born in a specific time and place, evolving through a narrative arc.

**Origins (Hypothetical Birth: 1915)**  
"Aquelarre Futurista" emerges in a fevered burst of creativity in 1915, conceived by a fictional Spanish-Italian artist, Mateo Velasco, a disciple of both Goya’s dark romanticism and Marinetti’s Futurist manifesto. Velasco, born in Madrid in 1885, grows up steeped in tales of the Spanish Inquisition and Goya’s Black Paintings, which he discovers in the Prado Museum. By 1910, he relocates to Milan, captivated by the Futurist fervor sweeping Italy. Amid the chaos of World War I—a conflict the Futurists glorify as the "world’s only hygiene"—Velasco envisions a synthesis of Goya’s witches’ sabbath with the machine age. His "Aquelarre Futurista" debuts as a massive canvas at a Milanese exhibition, shocking audiences with its blend of occult imagery and technological bravado.

**Early Life and Rise (1915-1920)**  
In its early years, "Aquelarre Futurista" is both celebrated and reviled. Futurist peers like Umberto Boccioni praise its audacity, seeing it as a bridge between Italian dynamism and Spanish mysticism. Velasco expands the concept into a multimedia spectacle—incorporating film reels of speeding cars and clattering factory floors, accompanied by a live performance of mechanical noise instruments. The work tours Turin, Rome, and Paris, aligning with the Futurist agenda to scandalize traditionalists. Critics decry it as a "monstrous hybrid," but its energy resonates with a war-torn generation hungry for radical change. By 1920, Velasco publishes a manifesto, "El Sabbat Mecánico," declaring the witches’ sabbath reborn as a ritual of industrial revolt.

**Maturity and Transformation (1920s-1930s)**  
As Futurism aligns with Italian Fascism, "Aquelarre Futurista" takes on a political edge. Velasco, now a prominent figure in avant-garde circles, adapts the work for propaganda—its mechanized Satan recast as a symbol of national strength, its witches as pioneers of a modern empire. Murals inspired by the piece appear in public squares, their jagged lines and roaring machines glorifying Mussolini’s regime. Yet, Velasco’s Spanish roots pull him back to Madrid in the 1930s, where the Spanish Civil War fractures his vision. Disillusioned by war’s brutality—echoing Goya’s own late-life despair—he reworks "Aquelarre Futurista" into a darker, more introspective form, stripping away some of its bombast to reveal a critique of unchecked progress.

**Legacy (1940s-Present)**  
Velasco dies in 1944, the same year as Marinetti, leaving "Aquelarre Futurista" as a polarizing artifact. Post-World War II, it fades from prominence as abstract expressionism overtakes the avant-garde, but it resurfaces in the 1960s during the neo-avant-garde revival. Scholars hail it as a prescient warning of technology’s double-edged sword—a theme resonant in the digital age. By April 8, 2025, "Aquelarre Futurista" exists as a cult classic, its original canvas housed in a speculative Museo de Vanguardias in Barcelona, inspiring artists to explore the intersection of tradition and innovation. Its "biography" mirrors the tumultuous arc of the 20th century, a testament to the enduring clash between humanity’s demons and its dreams.

### Conclusion

### Biography and Description of Lux Mundi (Electronic Music Artist)

Lux Mundi is an enigmatic and compelling figure in the contemporary electronic music scene, emerging from the vibrant, pulsating heart of Los Angeles, California. Known primarily for their mastery of the drum and bass subgenre, Lux Mundi has carved out a distinctive niche by blending high-energy rhythms, intricate sound design, and soulful undertones into a sonic tapestry that resonates with both dedicated fans of electronic music and casual listeners alike. The name "Lux Mundi," Latin for "Light of the World," reflects the artist’s ambition to illuminate the electronic music landscape with innovative compositions that push boundaries while remaining deeply immersive.

#### Early Life and Musical Roots
Born and raised in Los Angeles, Lux Mundi’s journey into music was shaped by the city’s eclectic cultural backdrop—a sprawling metropolis where Hollywood glamour collides with underground creativity. Growing up amidst this dynamic environment, Lux Mundi was exposed to a wide array of musical influences, from the hip-hop beats echoing through the streets to the experimental electronica pulsing in the city’s nightlife. While specific details about their early life remain scarce—perhaps intentionally so, adding to their mystique—it’s evident that their passion for music took root early on. As a young artist, they were drawn to the visceral energy of drum and bass, a genre born in the UK but adopted and reinterpreted by American producers with a unique flair.

Lux Mundi’s formative years likely involved tinkering with digital audio workstations and exploring the vast possibilities of electronic soundscapes. The influence of Los Angeles’ frenetic urban energy is palpable in their work, which often mirrors the city’s duality—its bright, sunlit optimism juxtaposed with its shadowy, restless undercurrents. This tension became a cornerstone of their creative identity, setting the stage for a career defined by both technical precision and emotional depth.

#### Rise in the Electronic Scene
Lux Mundi’s ascent in the music world began in the late 2010s to early 2020s, a period when electronic music was experiencing a renaissance, with subgenres like drum and bass gaining renewed traction among younger audiences. Their breakthrough came with a series of singles that showcased their ability to fuse pulsating basslines with intricate drum patterns and ethereal melodies. Tracks like "Ignition" (2021) and "Pyramid Song" (2021) introduced Lux Mundi as an artist unafraid to experiment within the confines of their chosen genre, delivering compositions that were both dancefloor-ready and introspective.

"Ignition," released in 2021, marked a pivotal moment. With its relentless tempo and layered textures, the track captured the raw energy of drum and bass while hinting at a broader artistic vision. "Pyramid Song," released the same year, took a slightly different approach, weaving hypnotic melodies into a framework of crisp, syncopated beats—a testament to Lux Mundi’s versatility. These early releases earned them a growing following, particularly among those who appreciated the genre’s complexity and its capacity for emotional storytelling.

By 2022, Lux Mundi had solidified their reputation with "Holding On," a track that exemplified their signature style: a driving rhythm section paired with an infectious groove that lingers long after the song ends. Critics and fans alike praised the track for its ability to transport listeners into a world of throbbing beats and uplifting sonic peaks, cementing Lux Mundi’s status as a rising star in the electronic music community.

#### Artistic Style and Approach
Lux Mundi’s music is characterized by its meticulous attention to detail and a relentless pursuit of immersive audio experiences. Their productions often feature pulsating basslines that anchor the tracks, overlaid with intricate drum patterns that shift and evolve unpredictably. This technical prowess is balanced by a keen ear for melody, with airy synths and soulful flourishes that add an emotional resonance to their work. The result is a sound that feels both cerebral and visceral—a journey through sound that engages the mind as much as it moves the body.

Drawing inspiration from the chaotic energy of Los Angeles, Lux Mundi’s compositions reflect a city in constant motion. Their tracks often evoke a sense of urgency and exploration, as if mirroring the sprawling highways and neon-lit nights of their hometown. Yet, there’s also a meditative quality to their music, a thread of introspection that invites listeners to lose themselves in the layers of sound. This duality—energy and contemplation—sets Lux Mundi apart from many of their peers in the drum and bass scene.

Collaboration has also played a role in Lux Mundi’s evolution. One notable partnership was their remix of "New High" by KiKi Holli, which demonstrated their ability to reimagine existing works through their distinctive lens. By infusing the original track with their trademark beats and atmospheric touches, Lux Mundi showcased a knack for collaboration that enhances rather than overshadows the source material.

#### Impact and Influence
Though still early in their career as of April 2025, Lux Mundi has already left an indelible mark on the electronic music landscape. Their ability to blend the raw power of drum and bass with a sophisticated, almost cinematic sensibility has earned them a dedicated fanbase and the respect of fellow producers. Platforms like Spotify, where they boast a modest but growing listener base (around 80 monthly listeners as of some reports), and 7digital, which offers high-quality downloads of their work, have helped amplify their reach.

Lux Mundi’s live performances—though details are sparse— are rumored to be electrifying, with the artist channeling the intensity of their recordings into sets that captivate audiences. Their commitment to pushing the boundaries of drum and bass, while honoring its roots, positions them as a forward-thinking force in a genre that thrives on innovation.

#### Personal Philosophy and Future Directions
While Lux Mundi keeps much of their personal life under wraps, their music suggests a deep passion for creativity and a desire to connect with listeners on a profound level. The choice of the name "Lux Mundi" hints at a philosophical underpinning—an aspiration to bring light through sound, to illuminate the complexities of human experience in a world often shrouded in noise and distraction.

Looking ahead, Lux Mundi shows no signs of slowing down. With each release, they continue to refine their craft, exploring new sonic territories while staying true to the core elements that define their sound. Rumors of forthcoming projects—perhaps an EP or full-length album—circulate among fans, promising to further expand their artistic footprint. As they evolve, Lux Mundi remains a beacon of originality in electronic music, a testament to the power of rhythm, melody, and imagination.

#### Legacy in the Making
As of April 8, 2025, Lux Mundi stands at the cusp of greater recognition. Their journey from the streets of Los Angeles to the playlists of electronic music enthusiasts worldwide is a story of talent, perseverance, and an unwavering commitment to their art. Whether they’re crafting a high-octane drum and bass anthem or layering subtle textures into a melodic interlude, Lux Mundi embodies the spirit of an artist who dares to dream big—lighting up the world, one beat at a time.

If you meant a different "+RAIN Film Festival" or specific artists, please clarify!

Below are biographies and descriptions of three music artists with potential relevance to the Raindance Film Festival, based on its history of celebrating music documentaries and hosting influential figures in music and film:

---

### 1. Iggy Pop
**Biography:**
James Newell Osterberg Jr., known professionally as Iggy Pop, was born on April 21, 1947, in Muskegon, Michigan, USA. Often hailed as the "Godfather of Punk," Iggy Pop rose to prominence as the frontman of the proto-punk band The Stooges, formed in 1967 in Ann Arbor, Michigan. His raw, visceral performance style and rebellious energy made him a countercultural icon. After The Stooges disbanded in 1974, Iggy embarked on a solo career, collaborating with artists like David Bowie, who produced his seminal albums *The Idiot* (1977) and *Lust for Life* (1977). Over decades, Iggy Pop has maintained a prolific career, blending punk, rock, and experimental sounds, while also acting in films such as *The Crow: City of Angels* (1996) and *Coffee and Cigarettes* (2003).

**Long Description:**
Iggy Pop’s connection to the Raindance Film Festival stems from his appearance as a notable guest, reflecting the festival’s interest in music documentaries and boundary-pushing artists. His life and career have been the subject of films like *Gimme Danger* (2016), directed by Jim Jarmusch, which premiered at Cannes and aligns with Raindance’s focus on innovative storytelling in music documentaries. Iggy’s music is characterized by its primal energy—his gravelly voice and chaotic stage antics, including stage-diving and self-mutilation, set a precedent for punk rock. Albums like *Raw Power* (1973) with The Stooges and solo works like *Post Pop Depression* (2016) showcase his evolution from garage rock to introspective art rock. Beyond music, his film roles and larger-than-life persona make him a fitting figure for a festival celebrating independent creativity. Raindance’s emphasis on first-time auteurs and edgy narratives mirrors Iggy’s own career, marked by defiance of mainstream norms and a DIY ethos.

### 2. Marky Ramone
**Biography:**
Marc Steven Bell, better known as Marky Ramone, was born on July 15, 1952, in Brooklyn, New York. A pivotal figure in punk rock, Marky is best known as the drummer for the Ramones, joining the band in 1978 after replacing Tommy Ramone. He played on iconic albums like *Road to Ruin* (1978), *End of the Century* (1980), and *Pleasant Dreams* (1981), contributing to the band’s signature fast-paced, minimalist sound. Before the Ramones, Marky was part of the hard rock band Dust and the punk outfit Richard Hell and the Voidoids. After leaving the Ramones in 1983 and returning in 1987, he remained until their dissolution in 1996. Post-Ramones, Marky has toured with his band Marky Ramone’s Blitzkrieg and worked as a producer and radio host.

**Long Description:**
Marky Ramone’s relevance to the Raindance Film Festival is tied to his status as a guest and the festival’s interest in punk culture and music documentaries. His participation reflects Raindance’s celebration of influential music figures whose stories resonate with independent filmmakers. Marky’s drumming defined the Ramones’ relentless tempo—typically 180 beats per minute—driving hits like “I Wanna Be Sedated” and “Rock ‘n’ Roll High School.” His style, marked by precision and endurance, helped cement the Ramones as pioneers of punk, influencing countless bands. Documentaries like *Ramones: Raw* (2004) and *End of the Century: The Story of the Ramones* (2003) capture his legacy, aligning with Raindance’s programming of music-focused narratives. Marky’s gritty, no-frills approach to music parallels the festival’s support for raw, unpolished indie works, making him a symbolic bridge between music and film at Raindance.

---

### 3. Lou Reed
**Biography:**
Lewis Allan Reed, known as Lou Reed, was born on March 2, 1942, in Brooklyn, New York, and passed away on October 27, 2013. A transformative figure in rock music, Reed gained fame as the lead singer and songwriter of The Velvet Underground, formed in 1964 with John Cale. The band’s debut album, *The Velvet Underground & Nico* (1967), produced by Andy Warhol, is a cornerstone of alternative music despite initial commercial failure. After leaving the band in 1970, Reed launched a solo career with albums like *Transformer* (1972), produced by David Bowie, featuring the hit “Walk on the Wild Side.” His work spanned glam rock, punk, and experimental music, with later albums like *Berlin* (1973) and *New York* (1989) showcasing his lyrical depth and sonic innovation.

**Long Description:**
Lou Reed’s association with the Raindance Film Festival comes through his attendance as a notable guest and the festival’s affinity for music documentaries exploring complex artists. His life has been chronicled in films like *Lou Reed’s Berlin* (2007), directed by Julian Schnabel, which fits Raindance’s focus on bold, unconventional storytelling. Reed’s music is a tapestry of urban poetry and avant-garde sound—his monotone delivery and stark lyrics about addiction, sexuality, and outsider life defied rock conventions. The Velvet Underground’s drone-heavy experimentation influenced punk and indie rock, while his solo work ranged from accessible pop to abrasive noise (*Metal Machine Music*, 1975). Raindance’s commitment to diverse voices and social narratives echoes Reed’s own unflinching exploration of human experience, making his legacy a natural fit for the festival’s ethos of discovery and artistic risk-taking.

'00:00:00', 'Anderson do Paraíso, widely known as DJ Anderson do Paraíso, is a Brazilian DJ and producer who has emerged as one of the most influential figures in the contemporary funk scene, particularly within the subgenre known as *funk mineiro* or *funk BH*. Hailing from Belo Horizonte, the capital of Minas Gerais and Brazil’s third-largest metropolitan area, Anderson has carved out a distinctive niche in the sprawling landscape of Brazilian funk, a genre that originated in the favelas of Rio de Janeiro but has since evolved into diverse regional styles across the country. At 27 years old, as of 2025, Anderson has already left an indelible mark on the global underground music scene with his haunting, minimalist, and cinematic approach to funk, blending traditional Brazilian rhythms with experimental electronic elements and an eerie, atmospheric edge.

### Early Life and Beginnings
Born and raised in the neighborhood of Padre Paraíso (meaning "Father Paradise") on the eastern hillside of Belo Horizonte, Anderson grew up in a city distinct from Brazil’s coastal metropolises like Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo. Belo Horizonte, often referred to as BH, is a landlocked urban center surrounded by mountains, known for its slower pace and unique cultural identity. While BH has historically been associated with legendary Brazilian musicians like Milton Nascimento and Clara Nunes, its funk scene began to take shape in the 1990s with a hip-hop-influenced style called *funk consciente*, which focused on social struggles and resilience in the face of adversity. By the late 2000s, however, the city’s street parties, or *bailes*, exploded in popularity, giving rise to a darker, more experimental strain of funk that Anderson would later help define.

Anderson’s musical journey began in 2012 when he started producing beats in his bedroom, initially drawing inspiration from Rio’s *funk tamborzão*—a fast-paced, drum-heavy style rooted in the iconic tamborim rhythm. However, his sound underwent a dramatic transformation between 2015 and 2016 when he became immersed in the *Baile do Serrão*, a legendary street party held in Aglomerado da Serra, Belo Horizonte’s largest favela and one of the biggest slum complexes in Latin America. The raw energy of these gatherings, combined with the evolving sound of BH’s funk scene, pushed Anderson to explore a slower, more atmospheric approach that contrasted sharply with the frenetic chaos of mainstream funk carioca.

### Rise to Prominence
By the mid-2010s, Anderson do Paraíso had become a central figure in the burgeoning *funk mineiro* movement, a style characterized by its sparse, minimalist production and an almost ghostly aesthetic. Unlike the heavy distortion of São Paulo’s *funk bruxaria* or the hip-hop-infused beats of Rio, BH funk embraced a refined elegance, with spaced-out rhythms, deep basslines, and an emphasis on silence as a tool for tension. Critics have described this sound as “ambient space funk,” a nod to its otherworldly quality, and Anderson quickly established himself as one of its sonic architects.

His early tracks, many of which were released as standalone singles or “loosies,” gained traction in BH’s underground scene and beyond, thanks to their provocative lyrics—often sexually explicit or darkly humorous—and innovative production. Collaborations with local MCs like MC GW, MC Magrella, and MC Paulin do G showcased his ability to pair stark, skeletal beats with vivid vocal performances, creating a sound that was both danceable and unsettling. Tracks like “Sadomasoquista,” “Paty Trem Barbie,” and “Chama Suas Colegas pra Brincar” became anthems in BH’s *bailes*, cementing his reputation as a producer who could push boundaries while staying true to the genre’s roots.

### Musical Style and Innovation
What sets Anderson do Paraíso apart is his fearless experimentation and willingness to subvert funk’s conventions. His music is defined by a deliberate use of silence and space, creating a reflective, almost meditative quality amidst the genre’s typical sensory overload. He strips funk down to its bare essentials, often forgoing the relentless drum patterns of traditional baile funk for metallic clanks, eerie moans, and slowed-down tempos. This minimalist approach, combined with his incorporation of classical instrumentation—such as the razor-sharp cello in “Sadomasoquista,” muted horns in “Joga Leite,” or fragile strings in “Se Faz de Santinha”—lends his tracks a cinematic tension that feels both sensual and menacing.

Anderson’s productions also draw from a wide range of influences, including vintage hip-hop, early dubstep, jazz, and folk, which he weaves into his beats with haunting samples and reverb-drenched effects. His debut album, *Queridão* (released in 2024 on Kampala-based label Nyege Nyege Tapes), exemplifies this eclectic style. The album is a reverb-soaked collage of low-end bass, high-pitched squeals, and whisper-quiet vocals, offering a slowed-down reinterpretation of funk that’s as terrifying as it is alluring. Tracks like “Aula de Putaria,” with its sparse kicks and spooky kamanche samples, or “Chama Suas Colegas pra Brincar,” with its Gregorian chants and church bells, showcase his ability to meld disparate elements into a cohesive, unsettling whole.

### *Queridão* and Global Recognition
*Queridão*, meaning “darling” or “beloved” in Portuguese, is both a nickname for Anderson and the title of his breakthrough album, which has been hailed as a milestone in Brazilian funk’s evolution. Released in early 2024, the album compiles some of his most iconic tracks into a cohesive package, introducing his idiosyncratic sound to an international audience. Critics have praised its ghostly, barebones aesthetic and its ability to translate the raw energy of BH’s street parties into a format accessible to listeners far removed from Brazil’s favelas. Publications like *Pitchfork*, *Mixmag*, and *Resident Advisor* have lauded Anderson for his innovative approach, with reviewers noting how his music toys with listeners by denying release, much like “the apparition of a lover you can’t reach.”

The album features a roster of guest vocalists from across Brazil, including MC Magrella, MC Maykin do BC, and MC Paulin do G, whose performances amplify the dark, playful, and often explicit themes that define *funk mineiro*. Tracks like “Sadomasoquista” and “Paty Trem Barbie” have become standout hits, blending Anderson’s signature production with the raw charisma of his collaborators. *Queridão* has also earned Anderson a spot on the global stage, with performances at festivals like Unsound and Le Guess Who?, where he’s been celebrated as a trailblazer in the underground electronic scene.

### Cultural Impact and Legacy
Anderson do Paraíso’s rise reflects a broader trend in Brazilian funk: the decentralization of the genre from its Rio origins into a kaleidoscope of regional styles. In Belo Horizonte, he’s become a living legend, ruling over the *bailes* in neighborhoods like Serra, Taquaril, and Inestan with a sound that’s distinctly his own. His music captures the spirit of BH’s peripheries—its gritty realities, subversive humor, and unapologetic vitality—while pushing the boundaries of what funk can be.

Beyond Brazil, Anderson’s work with Nyege Nyege Tapes has positioned him as part of a fiercely innovative wave of producers redefining dance music worldwide. His ability to fuse the chaotic energy of funk with a dark, experimental edge has drawn comparisons to early grime or dubstep pioneers, earning him a cult following among adventurous listeners and DJs. As *funk mineiro* gains global attention, Anderson remains at its forefront, a visionary artist whose music is as much a celebration of his roots as it is a bold leap into the unknown.

### Personal Life and Philosophy
Little is known about Anderson’s personal life, as he tends to let his music speak for itself. In interviews, he’s expressed a desire to create a sound that’s unmistakably his own, saying, “I like to have an identity—like when people listen to my music, they say: this is Anderson do Paraíso.” His preference for dark, cinematic tones—“The darker the better,” as he told Brazilian magazine *Volume Morto* in 2020—reflects a fascination with the occult and the atmospheric, a sensibility that permeates his work.

At just 27, Anderson do Paraíso is still early in his career, yet his impact is already profound. With *Queridão* as his calling card and a growing international presence, he stands poised to shape the future of funk—and electronic music at large—for years to come.

After starting her journey there, she became a global phenomenon. In 2025, she returns to Sónar by Night with a new, yet undisclosed, performance.', 'https://irjubpjnvgdhlyzigdpn.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/MySonar%20Videos//ARCA.mp4', 'VE', '22:00:00', '00:00:00', 'For the past nine years we’ve watched Alejandra Ghersi, better known as Arca, carve a blazing path through the zeitgeist–a shapeshifting celestial body, streaking across the cultural firmament. Every time we laid eyes on her she’d taken on some new form–noise musician, diva, philosopher, fashion plate, party girl, technologist. Every time it seemed like we had a grip on her she slipped right past our expectations, protean and elusive.
 
That liquid nature has allowed Arca’s talents to thrive in unexpected places. Beyond creating a dense and varied body of musical work, she’s for Björk, Kanye, and FKA twigs; composed for Museum of Modern Art and a retro gaming console; DJed Frank Ocean’s PREP+ party; and performed at a Burberry runway show for Riccardo Tisci. She’s painted her own album art, modeled, co-designed next-generation musical instruments, and built an online community for the horde of self-proclaimed “mutants” who follow her. Seemingly disparate things that in retrospect add up to a single, ever-growing holistic work.
 
But these are only snapshots, artifacts of the ceaseless movement from one state to the next. Arca’s true artistic medium is transformation itself. It exists in the quantum-like state of infinite potential, further out towards the edge of possibility than most people dare to go. 
 
“I don't want to be tied to one genre,” Arca says. “I don't want to be labeled as one thing.”
Her Grammy-nominated 2020 album KiCK i is a hologram holding all of her musical identities—at least the ones she’s shown us so far—in a state of simultaneous superimposition. Turn it one way and you find Arca the beatmaker, who first grabbed our attention in 2012 with the fractalized club music of her Stretch 1 & 2 EPs. Turn it another way and you encounter a mischievous mind that’s reverse-engineering contemporary pop and re-coding it in her own image. Turn it yet another and you find a Latin chanteuse who first emerged under the name Ghersi--exploring gender on/off stage, through live in-person and online performances. It was through this she came to identify as a nonbinary trans woman. 
 
As Arca has evolved, she’s dissolved the distinctions between the artist, her art, and the tools she uses to create it. The four-night performance piece, Mutant:Faith, that she debuted at The Shed in 2019, was built around custom-built technology she co-designed that transformed her body into an instrument in ways that have never been tried on stage before—myoelectric sensors that let her play sound with her muscles, a 9-foot-tall dance pole that generated noise through skin contact, and gear that translated her movements into MIDI notes. Since the pandemic has kept away from the stage, she’s continued to experiment with new ways of interfacing with technology, like using software from London-based AI startup Bronze to create 100 different AI-generated remixes of the KiCK i track “Riquiquí.”
 
Sometimes, Arca feels like a shard of some potential future jutting into the here and now. But while her work—and she herself—can feel science-fictional, it’s not just theoretical. She seems to emanate change—an extradimensional beacon guiding us into unexplored worlds, splicing snippets of alien DNA into our psychic code. Her musical ideas reverberate through popular music at every level. The experimental instruments she’s helping to design are opening the door to body-based controllers for the mass market. Her Discord group Mutants1000000 has grown into a refuge for “mutants” who share her dream of reshaping the world to fit them better, and who have the potential to effect change in ways that even Arca can’t predict.   
 
The cover of KiCK i has become the defining image of Arca in this phase of her evolution. She is standing tall and still, the soft curves of her almost-naked body wrapped in the hard metal embrace of a cybernetic exoskeleton. Stilt-like legs give her body a threatening animal posture, and long, curved claws extend downward from her wrists. She’s a war machine at rest, but the expression on her face is serene.

This is a man driven by an unbridled and relentless passion for music. Armin van Buuren is a born perfectionist, striving to stay on top of the scene he’s helped build. As the flag-bearer of the trance movement, he’s one of the most influential figures in EDM worldwide. Even though he lives an extraordinary life as one of the world’s most popular DJs, he has always remained a down-to-earth guy. Armin van Buuren is constantly on the move, whether creating music in his studio or en route to his next high-end club or festival show around the globe.
Armin: “It’s not just love for music, it’s my passion. It goes beyond liking, and beyond a hobby. It’s about a way of living. Music is essential to my life.”
For more than twenty years, the Grammy-nominated Dutchman has been living to the rhythm of his own international success. His five-time number one position in the critically acclaimed DJ Mag Top 100 DJs poll has been the result of his loyalty to fans, his creativity in the studio, the perseverance with which he hosts his weekly radio show ‘A State of Trance’ and the energy he brings to the crowds in front of him. Despite the heavy pressure that comes with being one of the world’s most popular DJs, Armin has always kept his focus on the music. And that’s exactly what keeps him going.
HOW IT ALL BEGAN 
Born in Leiden, the Netherlands (December 25, 1976) to a musical family, Armin indulged his passion for music from a young age. He spent all of the money he earned from his paper route on records. His mom won a computer when he was 10, piquing Armin’s interest in technology. “So as a little nerdy kid I was writing my own basic programs and learnt about the technology from there.” Armin progressed from making low-profile mix tapes for friends to high-end mixes when he started experimenting with different sequences on his computer through his uncle. “I was so stunned by what I saw him doing on the computer that I got addicted to creating music right there and then!”
“I loved dance music immediately – this great rebellious sound that was so different from the ‘beautiful’ songs of the years before.” Armin cites electronic pioneer Jean-Michel Jarre as a major influence, as well as Dutch producer Ben Lie-brand, who later mentored him in his mixing and producing.
In the early days, Armin thought it was wise to have a back-up plan, and so he studied for a law degree. The final year of his course was inevitably stretched out as he juggled his studies with his increasingly hectic schedule; his rise to fame included lots of productions and remixes, as well as playing in front of packed clubs every weekend. It took him three years to graduate, but his determination made him succeed.
Despite having a Master’s degree in Law, the main ingredient in Armin’s life has always been music. Armin: “I see it as my responsibility to promote trance as a genre, and I want to support it in every way I can. Music should connect us. As long as the music keeps evolving like it is, I will continue and I don’t see any reason to slow down.”
THE DJ
No matter how many hours Armin van Buuren has travelled to get there, as soon as he enters the DJ booth, the Dutch-man puts his full focus on the music, the crowd and how those two will combine. Once the beats of his first record kick in, the room lights up and chanting starts to fill the air. To witness a set by Armin van Buuren is to be blown away — to lose yourself completely in the music and become one with the people around you. Mixing seamlessly, he has created his own sound and style, making his DJ sets a truly unique experience. He unites millions, not only through the gigs in his challenging schedule, but also through his ‘Armin Only’ and ‘A State of Trance’ world tours.
His busy life as a DJ has inspired countless people both personally and professionally. In 2009, Dutch author Coen Bom presented his on-the-road biography of Armin called ‘Eén op één’ / ‘Armin Only’, in which he reported on the hectic life of Armin and tried to find the secret behind the grand success of the humble Dutchman. In October 2012, the official documentary ‘A Year With Armin van Buuren’ was released, in which Armin was followed during an important year in his life, offering a unique look behind the scenes and inside his personality. Again and again, his life as a superstar DJ con-tinues to inspire others.
Armin has the privilege of performing at some of the world’s biggest and best festivals, clubs, events and shows. One of the highlights of his career was performing for the newly crowned King and Queen of the Netherlands in 2013, Willem-Alexander and Máxima. Together with the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra and in front of the monarchs and 15,000 fans, he performed both ‘The Bolero’ as well as an orchestral version of the title track from his ‘Intense’ album. During the ‘Koningsvaart’ (a special, cultural boat trip through the city of Amsterdam), the King and Queen surprised both the crowd and Armin by getting on stage and dancing along with him.
Another memorable highlight of Armin’s career was his DJ set at the Museumplein in Amsterdam in July of 2010, during the ceremonial honoring of the Dutch national soccer team. Even though the national team lost in the FIFA World Cup final, they partied like they were the absolute winners with a crowd of 200,000 strong.
In 2013, Armin’s career hit a new milestone when he became the first solo dance artist to play in Madison Square Gar-den. The event was completely sold out, representing another crowning achievement for the DJ.
After the 2013 summer season had ended (along with his residency at the world’s biggest club, Privilege in Ibiza), Armin kicked off a new ‘Armin Only’ world tour based on his ‘Intense’ album, in collaboration with theatre director Jos Thie. More than 33 dates were set, with shows landing in cities such as Kiev, Mumbai, Saint-Petersburg, Helsinki, New York, Toronto, Mexico City, Sydney, Johannesburg, and more. With the ‘Armin Only’ tour, Armin brandished a unique and ex-clusive show format, which unfolded like the many layers of his ‘Intense’ album. In total, more than 500,000 visitors at-tended, spanning 5 continents. A ‘Road Movie’ series was also created, documenting behind-the-scenes footage of the entire tour as it took place. 
In 2014, Armin began a highly successful weekly residency at the famous Ushuaïa Beach Hotel in Ibiza, playing every Thursday night from June 26th to September 11th alongside top DJs from the Armada Music roster. After the residency, he released a compilation entitled ‘A State of Trance at Ushuaïa Ibiza’ to commemorate the season. 
As if to underline the success of the residency, Armin returned to the Ushuaïa Beach Hotel a year later for another ‘A State Of Trance at Ushuaïa, Ibiza’ summer. His performances in the center of the Ushuaïa pool were met with wide-spread passion and enthusiasm amongst his fans, subsequently leading to the release of the second volume of his Ushuaïa compilation series: ‘A State Of Trance at Ushuaïa, Ibiza 2015’.
On January 26th, 2016, Armin van Buuren announced the first two dates of his brand-new Armin Only Embrace world tour, to which even more dates were added later on through a live announcement at A State Of Trance Festival Utrecht on February 27th. ‘Armin Only:  Embrace’ has since seen a spectacular kick-off in Amsterdam, the Netherlands and has brought a spectacular offering to other cities, including Gdansk (Poland), Dubai (UAE), Sofia (Bulgaria), Minsk (Belarus), and Mexico City (Mexico and more.
In 2017, on Friday, May 12th and Saturday, May 13th, Armin van Buuren celebrated his twenty-year anniversary as an artist in one of the most prestigious venues of the Netherlands. Both shows in the Amsterdam ArenA sold out in no time, which allowed Armin van Buuren to celebrate the special occasion with tens of thousands of his most loyal fans and to create a memory able to withstand the test of time. 
In the summer of 2017, Armin van Buuren returned to the White Isle for another highly anticipated summer residency. Gracing Hï Ibiza - one of Ibiza’s newest and hottest clubs - with sublime Wednesday Night shows alongside fellow-Dutchmen and friends Sunnery James & Ryan Marciano, Armin van Buuren does what he does best: rousing crowds beyond belief and giving them the time of their lives for the full duration of the show. 
At the start of 2018, Armin van Buuren announced his return to Hï Ibiza alongside Sunnery James & Ryan Marciano to dive into the Ibiza madness for another glorious summer chock-full of stellar club performances and epic festival live sets, such as the seven-hour-long live set at Untold Festival in Romania. One year later, in 2019, Armin van Buuren still heads up the Wednesday Night shows at Hï Ibiza during the summer. 
In 2022, two years later than originally planned due to the Corona pandemic, Armin van Buuren will play his most per-sonal and intimate live shows yet through four sold-out shows in the Ziggo Dome: ‘This Is Me’.
THE RADIO HOST
What started as an obsession for radio has turned into a weekly highlight for more than 44 million listeners, broadcast-ing to over 100 FM stations and fans from 80+ countries. In June 2001, Armin van Buuren aired the first episode of ‘A State of Trance’. Eighteen years later, he still hosts the weekly two-hour show, where he presents the biggest tunes of the moment and provides an interactive way for fans to discover new music. Regular features of the show are the ‘Tune of the Week’, ‘Progressive Pick’, ‘Service For Dreamers’ and the ‘Future Favorite’, the latter of which is based on an online voting poll.
Celebrating each milestone, Armin did an extensive world tour based around the 650th episode of ASOT in early 2014. The ‘New Horizons’ world tour landed in the cities of Moscow, Yekaterinburg, Almaty, Utrecht, Santiago, Buenos Aires, Jakarta, Kuala Lumpur, and Miami. The 8-week tour took place in January, February, and March of 2014 and included nine shows in countries all around the globe, with events broadcast live on the A State of Trance website. 
In continuation of the success of ASOT, Armin kicked off his A State of Trance Festival tour. ASOT Festival was a new concept developed for 2015 in conjunction with ASOT Episode #700. Armin van Buuren became the first DJ to have his own festival: the biggest trance festival tour in history. The tour invaded Utrecht, Buenos Aires, Ultra Music Festival in Miami, Sydney and Melbourne, Mexico, and other destinations worldwide. Episode #700 was also the first time that an entirely fan-created show was used, with fans being given the chance to present their favorite tracks on air. Fans were asked to submit voice recordings of themselves introducing their favorite trance tracks of all time, and the resultant songs and recordings were used to create an entirely fan-made episode, which marked the first time in the world a major dance radio show has ever done this. 
After very successful editions of ASOT 750, ASOT 800 and ASOT 850, the A State Of Trance event series hit ASOT 900 on a high note, celebrating no less than 900 episodes of the radio show with a huge event in Utrecht, the Netherlands, which attracted a crowd of 33.000 strong. ASOT 950 naturally followed suit one year later, and Armin van Buuren’s in-ternationally acclaimed radio show has since surpassed the milestone number of 1000 episodes, with an epic ASOT 1000 celebration weekend scheduled for February 2020. 
Reflecting upon the ‘A State of Trance’ world tours, Armin says: “I’m deeply honored by all the positive things that are happening for the show and for the sound in general. I’ve always said ASOT is not only a show for, but also a show by the fans. The show wouldn’t be where it is without the fans, so it feels amazing to see so many people celebrating along. It’s crazy to see groups of fans going crazy to the same music that we’re playing on the other side of the world. People wearing banners, flags, and making their own private party. This is what I meant with ‘turning the world into a dance floor’.”
Each year, the listeners of the show are asked to vote for their favorite records of the year, with the ‘A State of Trance Top 20’ as the official result. Each track on this list ends up in the ‘A State of Trance Year Mix’, released at the end of December. Weeks of editing and mixing come together in a two-hour mega mix showcasing over a hundred tracks and countless memories. Several hundred thousand copies of the series have been sold to date, and the series has been going strong for almost fifteen years. Another series that Armin has linked to the radio show is the ‘A State of Trance Classics’ compilation. After years of providing some of the most essential classics and all-time favorites in EDM, the series continues to commemorate the early days of dance music. Furthermore, Armin was awarded 4x certified Plati-num for his ASOT Year Mix series in late 2014.

In addition to the radio show, Armin started the weekly ‘A State of Trance Podcast’ with a selection from the previous episode of the radio show, ensuring that listeners never miss out on any highlights. Every Sunday, Armin also hosts a 24-hour radio day called ‘A State of Sundays’, broadcast on one of the biggest radio stations in the United States: Sirius XM Satellite Radio. In addition to the A State of Trance shows, A State of Sundays also introduces its listeners to the sets and radio shows of other popular DJs and talented artists.

In 2017, Armin van Buuren opened a brand-new radio studio in the HQ of Armada Music in Amsterdam, from which all latest episodes of A State Of Trance are broadcast in audio and video.



THE PRODUCER
Whenever he’s not on tour or having a daddy day with his daughter Fenna and son Remy, Armin locks himself up in the studio. Giving meaning to his famous quote “Don’t be a prisoner of your own style”, he explores the boundaries of EDM through his originals and remixes. Some of his most beloved works, such as ‘Communication’, ‘Burned With Desire’, ‘Blue Fear’, ‘Shivers’, and ‘Yet Another Day’, have grown into highly revered classics, withstanding the test of time.
Armin van Buuren can now look back on the success of his ‘76’ (2003), ‘Shivers’ (2005), ‘Imagine’ (2008), ‘Mirage’ (2010), ‘Intense’ (2013) and ‘Embrace’ (2015) albums, whilst gearing up for the release of his seventh artist album, ‘Balance’, on October 25, 2019. ‘Intense’ was nominated for the Dutch Edison Pop Award for ‘Best Dance Album’. The follow-up to his ‘Mirage’ album featured collaborations with Israeli violinist Miri Ben-Ari, Australian duo NERVO, and singers like Trevor Guthrie, Emma Hewitt, Laura Jansen, Fiora, and more. ‘This Is What It Feels Like’ ft. Trevor Guthrie (the first single off the album) was nominated for the Grammy award for ‘Best Dance Recording’ and also received a nomination for a Canadi-an Juno Award. It became a worldwide hit, reaching A-List rotation on radio stations all across the globe and receiving silver, gold, platinum, and double platinum certifications in countries such as Canada, the Netherlands, the UK, Australia, and Italy. The video has reached over 64 million views to date.
After indulging his fans with a fresh Armin van Buuren presents Rising Star record (‘Safe Inside You’ feat. Betsie Larkin), an official remix of the ‘Game Of Thrones Theme’, and a collaboration with Electronic Music pioneer Jean-Michel Jarre (‘Stardust’), Armin announced the name of his forthcoming artist album during his ASOT radio show on Thursday, Sep-tember 3, 2015. 
‘Embrace’ emerged as Armin’s sixth full-length artist album on October 29, filled with remarkable collaborations with the likes of Mr. Probz (‘Another You’), Hardwell (‘Off The Hook’), Cimo Fränkel (‘Strong Ones’), world-famous Dutch Jazz trumpeter Eric Vloeimans (‘Embrace’) award-winning Dutch band Kensington (‘Heading Up High’), U.K. singer-songwriter BullySongs (‘Freefall’ and ‘Caught In The Slipstream’) and fellow Grammy nominee Gavin DeGraw (‘Looking For Your Name’).
Said Armin of the stylistic diversity of ‘Embrace’, “Each of the instruments you see on the album cover – which was shot by Anton Corbijn – was an instrument actually used on the album! I thought it would be a real challenge to myself to try to create dance music using all of these disparate instruments. I really wanted to push myself past my comfort zone and create something very exciting not just for me, but for all the lovers of music out there. I hope you enjoy it.” Judging by the ecstatic reaction of audiences whenever Armin plays his album cuts onstage, he has, once again, succeeded.

In August 2016, Armin van Buuren put out his ‘Old Skool’ mini album. Inspired by the track ‘Old Skool’ on the ‘Embrace’ album, Armin van Buuren went on to revamp timeless classics such as Human Resource – ‘Dominator’, The Ultimate Seduction – ‘The Ultimate Seduction’, Speedy J – ‘Pull Over’, and more. The result, a seven-piece mini album, takes his fans back to where it all started by brandishing a piece of dance music history.

Always striving to step out of his comfort zone, Armin van Buuren turned 2017 into an excellent year by dropping three summer-flavored smashes: ‘I Need You’ (with Garibay feat. Olaf Blackwood), ‘Sunny Days’ (feat. Josh Cumbee) and ‘You Are’ with Sunnery James & Ryan Marciano, the anthem for their joint summer residency at Hï Ibiza. And if that didn’t prove versatile enough, he dove into previous uncharted territory with his first single of 2018: ‘Sex, Love & Water’ (feat. Conrad Sewell), a delicious mash of funk and disco. The rest of 2018 saw him deliver more amazing pop-dance singles in the form of ‘Therapy’ and ‘Wild Wild Son’, but also saw him dive into his Trance roots with tremor-like festival anthems such as ‘The Last Dancer’ with Shapov, the gimmicky ‘Blah Blah Blah’, ‘Our Origin’ (also with Shapov) and the sublime ‘United’, a high-intensity anthem made in collaboration with Vini Vici and Alok. In 2019, Armin van Buuren continued where he left off, releasing more powerful bangers (e.g. ‘Turn It Up’, ‘Show Me Love’ (with Above & Beyond)) and lovely crossbreed singles (e.g. ‘Lonely For You’ (feat. Bonnie McKee), ‘Don’t Give Up On Me’ (with Lucas & Steve feat. Josh Cumbee)). It shows just how open-minded Armin van Buuren is and that’s exactly what made him remain a top player to this day.

On October 25, Armin van Buuren released his seventh artist album, ‘Balance’. The album consists of 28 tracks, and includes well-known singles such as ‘Blah Blah Blah’, ‘Sunny Days’ and ‘Phone Down’ as well as new collaborations with the likes of NE-YO (‘Unlove You’), MatLuck (‘Don’t Let Me Go’) and Tempo Giusto (‘Mr. Navigator’). Armin van Buuren even launched his own limited-time ‘Balance’ escape room in Amsterdam to celebrate the release of the album.
As stated by Armin van Buuren, the album is about thinking in possibilities rather than definition, thinking about what music could be instead of what it should be. “Every song I make teaches me something new, and the next song is always a result of all my previous records, the new things I learned and the people I met”, the world-renowned DJ and producer says in the foreword of his album. “Over the years, this process - and especially the fun of creating - became more and more important to me. It’s a journey that gives me meaning and helps me learn more about my personal interests ra-ther than focus on the recognition I get for the outcome. That’s the big difference between who I am today and who I was a few years ago. ‘BALANCE’ is a new chapter in my book of life, the result of venturing into known and unknown territories while finding the balance in between. This creative journey gives me the energy to do what I do, to keep go-ing.”
In 2020, Armin van Buuren continued to put out more admirable creations. Among those are his ‘RELAXED’ chill album, which features acoustic versions and chill remixes of some of his biggest tracks to date, and ‘All On Me’, his genre-crossing single with Hardstyle pioneer Brennan Heart.  

In 2021, Armin van Buuren not only released his first-ever collab with Swedish dance music star Alesso (‘Leave A Little Love’), EDM juggernaut Steve Aoki (‘Music Means Love Forever’) and Dutch vocal sensation Davina Michelle (‘Hold On’), but also released the first volume of his new ‘A State Of Trance FOREVER’ album series, which features collaborations with some of the biggest artists in Trance and Progressive. 
THE LABEL OWNER
In 2003, plans emerged to set up a record label. Together with Maykel Piron and David Lewis (Ar-Ma-Da), Armin found-ed Armada Music. Today, Armada Music is the biggest independent dance music label in the world, based in Amster-dam (HQ), London and New York (satellite offices). 
Armada Music represents labels and artists across the electronic music spectrum, releasing music from the likes of  including Andrew Rayel, Armin van Buuren, ARTY, Erick Morillo, Ferry Corsten, Kevin Saunderson, Lost Frequencies, Loud Luxury, Morgan Page and W&W. Armin’s own ‘Armind’, ‘A State of Trance’, and ‘Who’s Afraid Of 138?!’ labels also operate under the wing of Armada Music, and the labels take a leading role in releasing Armin’s artist albums and ‘A State of Trance’ mix albums. Armada Music was voted #7 in Mixmag’s “Label Of The Decade” poll in 2017. One year later, in 2018, the label won the International Dance Music Award for ‘Best Global Label’ for the sixth time. 
Despite his ambitious and hectic schedule, Armin still serves as A&R manager for his own Armind, Who’s Afraid Of 138?!, and A State of Trance labels.
THE AMBASSADOR

In the modern age, it can be hard to find artists with such range of energy and emotions as
Barry Can’t Swim.
His style – pulling vocals and samples from all over the world – is composed in an almost
progressive-jazz nature: eclectic, dynamic, and almost spiritual at times.
Born in Edinburgh, the now London-based producer came from humble beginnings. First
learning on the piano his grand-father rescued from a local charity shop. Obsessive by
nature, every chapter in his younger years revolved around music in some sense.
Working behind the bar in a local spot, performing in bands through his teenage years,
before eventually honing his craft and studying music at Edinburgh Napier university.
It was around this time that Barry - real name Joshua Mainnie - discovered the burgeoning
UK electronic scene. Artists like Jamie xx and Daniel Avery coming through Scottish
nightclubs like Sneaky Pete’s and Sub Club, inspired Mainnie to evolve his own writing, and
apply the fundamentals he learned in piano, guitar and drums into the infinite realm of
electronic production.
Eventually making the move to London, he put his first record out in 2020 – a self-release
titled “Because I Wanted You To Know”
.
Immediately winning fans with his unique sound and more-than-memorable alias, Barry
Can’t Swim consistently grew through underground UK labels, before eventually signing to
Ninja Tune in 2021. His first EP on the label -
‘More Content’
- put the Scotsman right up
alongside Bonobo, Bicep and Peggy Gou, as one of the most exciting electronic artists in the
scene.
‘When Will We Land?’ marked the debut album in October 2023. Written with friends, taking
samples from family, and encompassing of all Mainnie’s musical influences; it is a piece
described by its creator as “a reflection and appreciation of all the people, music and
moments that have led me to this point in my life”
.
A huge success both critically and commercially, the album reached #12 in the UK Album
Charts, #5 in the Scottish equivalent, and saw Mainnie receive nominations in the Mercury
Prize and BRIT Awards.
Simultaneously to this, Mainnie made the brave evolution from club DJ to live electronic act;
in order to allow a fuller expression and the creative world around his art.
The people were clearly ready for it. With sold-out shows and tours all over the world –
London, Glasgow, Dublin Los Angeles, Chicago, Vancouver, Phoenix, Melbourne, Sydney,
Amsterdam and beyond… Along with roadblock festival appearances at the likes of
Coachella (US), Pukkelpop (Belgium), Roskilde (Denmark), Reading & Leeds (UK), and
most notably – a record-breaking crowd at The Park Stage of Glastonbury (UK).
Never one to self-admire or rest on his achievements, Mainnie continues to write new music.
Arguably his biggest single to date,
“Still Riding” arrived to huge international response in
October 2024, after two years of requesting Kali Uchis’ permission to sample. Perhaps
becoming a fan herself in the process…
With a sold-out tour UK/EU tour coming up – including 3 x Brixton Academies (London) – a
debut live tour in North America – including huge shows at Shrine (LA) and Terminal 5
(NYC) – festival appearances in South America, Australia, New Zealand, and a second

friends who bonded over a shared love of dance music. In the decades since first meeting,
aged 8, Bicep have become one of the world’s most avidly appreciated curators and
producers of electronic music.
Recently hailed by the BBC as “one of the biggest names in UK dance”
, Bicep continue to
cement themselves as one of the defining global electronic acts of our times. Their most
recent release “Water”
— which arrived alongside a mind-bending video directed by
celebrated filmmaker Aoife McArdle — was described as nothing short of “anthemic” by
Mixmag, and saw Billboard opine that the duo “consistently creates some of the most
powerful electronic atmospheres on the market”
, as well as commending their “mind-blowing
live performances.
”

In 2022 Bicep also played their biggest UK Live shows to date with back-to-back
performances at London’s 10k capacity Alexandra Palace on 2nd and 3rd of December —
both of which sold out in just 5 minutes — a headline arena-tour throughout Europe
including Zenith Paris, Lotto Arena Antwerp and UFO Velodrom Berlin, and a run of
high-profile festival and headline shows across North America which included Primavera LA
and Portola festival in San Francisco. They will also embark on a sold-out tour of Australia in
2023 including stops in Sydney, Melbourne, and Brisbane.
Comfortably installed as one of the biggest names in dance music, Bicep released their hotly
anticipated second album,
‘Isles’
, in January 2021. Met with widespread acclaim from critics
and fans alike,
’Isles’ was described as "a tour de force of neon euphoria" (Resident
Advisor),
"brimming with restless energy" (Evening Standard),
“one of the defining dance
music albums of 2021” (Mixmag),
"intricate, moody, nostalgic, introspective and emotional”
(Billboard) and named The Guardian’s ‘Album of the Week’
. It debuted at #2 on the UK
Official Albums Chart and #1 on the UK Official Vinyl Albums Chart, earning the duo two
BRITs nominations — for Best British Group & Breakthrough Act — in the process.
Born and raised in Belfast, the pair’s home listening ran the gamut from Slayer and
Tangerine Dream to Irish legends Thin Lizzy, Rory Gallagher and Moya Brennan. Both,
however, cut their musical teeth in their hometown’s thriving club scene, centred around
legendary Belfast venue Shine.
“Going to Shine was like being smacked in the head with a hammer” says Matt.
“It was either
very intense, in-your-face italo tinged electro or really aggressive techno. Anything that
sounded moderate was back bar music. The main rooms were always harder”
.
“If it wasn’t energetic, it was boring” says Andy, of the music that predominated at the time.
“Especially in the 90s, even the local radio there would be playing trance hits. It was way
more ingrained in Belfast than in London”
.
Shine became a breeding ground for the city’s DJs and producers, as well as a welcome
respite from the divisions that predominated in Belfast at that time.
“It’s a cliché” says Matt,
“but dance music will have a big effect in such a place. I think that’s why it was,
-----

subconsciously, a bit more important there. No matter what, it gave people a chance to
switch off, even just socially, to not feel it was us versus them”
.
The duo parted ways after school, both leaving Belfast for further afield. Andy went to study
Chemical Engineering in Manchester, while Matt studied design in Newcastle, but both took
their love of dance music with them, regularly one-upping each other with deep cuts and lost
classics they’d email back and forth. This habit grew to become FeelMyBicep, the blog they
started in 2008 as a showcase for their favourite lost-but-not-yet-forgotten synth, house, funk
and Italo disco rarities.
From those humble origins, FeelMyBicep became a vital online destination for dance music
afficionados, regularly chalking up over 100,000 visitors a month. This spawned a club night,
and record label, while its signature Bicep trefoil logo - designed by Matt himself - became
one of the most iconic symbols in underground dance music. It wasn’t long before the pair
graduated to being highly sought-after DJs, their sets reflecting the eclecticism of these
online curations.
Initially playing individually as FeelMyBicep in Europe and Asia, they reunited in London and
“have been making music every day since”
. As producers, too, they soon found success.
Following a releases on Throne of Blood, Will Saul soon snapped them up for a string of
releases on his Aus Music imprint. Chief among these was the certified classic “Just EP”
,
whose dazzling title track became the undisputed club sound of 2015, earning both Mixmag
and DJ Mag’s ‘Track of the Year’
.
Bicep have collaborated repeatedly with compatriot Hammer, as well as with another
groundbreaking UK duo, Simian Mobile Disco. They’ve also remixed for the likes of Blood
Orange and 808 State, and been remixed by industry titans Steffi and Four Tet.
Signed to Ninja Tune in 2017, their self-titled debut album was released to universal acclaim
later that year.
“Bicep” attained a Top 20 entry in the UK charts, garnering plaudits from the
likes of Pitchfork, Resident Advisor and the Guardian, as well as a cover feature in Mixmag
to add to that magazine’s gong for “Album of the Year”
. Tracks like ‘Opal’
— and the
subsequent Four Tet remix— as well as he record’s lead single ‘Glue’
, with and its iconic Joe
Wilson-directed video, became touchpoints for electronic music in 2017, with the latter

named DJ Mag “Track of the Year”
. The ‘Glue’ video, alongside Bicep’s RA Live performance
were also recently included in the lauded ‘Electronic’ exhibition, first shown at the
Philharmonie de Paris last year and most recently at London’s Design Museum.
The pair cite moving to London, and the breadth of music this exposed them to, as key to
their growth as musicians in this time, expanding their musical pallet with a world of new
sounds, taken from every conceivable source. Both cite the joy of discovering Hindi vocals,
Bulgarian choirs, or manically hitting Shazam in the hopes of identifying a Turkish pop song
in a Dalston kebab house. London offered Bicep the sounds of Detroit, Delhi, Durban and
Derby, all in one place.
“We embraced it” says Andy.
“There’s so much choice. You just don’t get bored. When we
arrived here, you could go to a different night every day of the week, that was the big selling
point for us. The amount of excitement and hunger, the chance to experience new things, it
was off the charts. So, we came and lived on the breadline for a few years, not even phased
at all”
.
These influences fed into their second LP,
“Isles”
, a record they describe as being more
moody and introspective than their debut.
“The previous record was written from a very
happy and almost naïve place” says Andy.
“Our starting point was very different this time”
.
Drawn from 150 demos, its ten tracks see the pair distilling their sound to its purest essence,
from harder Belfast origins to the more global and contemplative influences they’ve picked
up across the water.
Debuting 2017, their Bicep Live show is now an infamous spectacle, renowned for its epic,
immersive production and visuals from Black Box Echo’s Zak Norman. Their subsequent
touring has seen them play across some of the world’s most revered festival stages, as well
as sold-out headline shows across the UK, Europe, North America and beyond.
Almost 1 million people will have had the chance to see Bicep play live in 2022, including
headline performances at Glastonbury — where they closed the festival’s second biggest
stage in front of 35k people with a now legendary set that was televised by the BBC —
Primavera (Barcelona and Los Angeles), Parklife, Wide Awake, AVA and Field Day. They
also completed a sold-out UK tour that included three headline shows at London’s O2

Academy Brixton, and two North American tours that included a sold-out show at NYC’s
Knockdown Center, Portola festival San Francisco and shows in Denver, Chicago, Austin
and more.
The closing night of their triumphant three-night sold-out run of shows at Printworks in
London in 2018 was recorded by Resident Advisor for their ‘RA Live’ series, with 3.2 million
views to date on YouTube alone, and in September 2020, with the live music & touring
industry in a state of flux, Bicep announced an innovative one-off ticketed livestream
performance — one of the first of its kind for an electronic artist — broadcast across 5
different timezones, and watched by people in over 70 countries.
Bicep are also ambassadors for Youth Music, a charity working to change the lives of young
people through music and music production. The pair take an active role in mentoring young
people coming through YM programmes, reflecting their own eagerness to give back as

La productora y DJ gallego-catalana Cora Novoa nos presenta su
nuevo show audiovisual con motivo del lanzamiento de su tercer álbum
de estudio: This is not about you and me. This is about us, que supone
el cierre de la trilogía Mental Diary con su ACT III y se convierte en su
álbum más vanguardista y conceptual hasta la fecha.
Conceptualmente, supone un viaje por las complejidades de la
existencia humana en la era digital, reflexionando sobre temas como el
cambio climático, la IA y la búsqueda de un sentido de comunidad en
un mundo cada vez más fragmentado y polarizado. Un álbum que se
mueve entre el techno y el pop vaporoso, que ha sido producido con

Born in Tokyo in 1976, Daito Manabe grew up in a household of musician parents, where he was exposed to music and synthesizers from an early age while also becoming familiar with interactive expression through video games and programming. In his youth, he immersed himself in hip-hop culture and was active as a DJ. After acquiring drum machines and computers, he deepened his interest in digital expression while handling programming and scratching in a jazz band. While studying mathematics at Tokyo University of Science, he was strongly influenced by Iannis Xenakis and began researching mathematical approaches to music generation. This direction of merging mathematics, music, and programming established during this period would become the core of his future creative activities.
After working as an engineer, he returned to art school to study media art and sound programming, then founded Rhizomatiks in 2006. Beginning with his production work for Perfume, which sparked his full-scale exploration of the fusion between technology and physical expression using advanced technology such as Mixed Reality, he went on to direct live performances for Björk and collaborate with artists such as Arca and Nosaj Thing, as well as creating visual works for experimental electronic musicians including OK Go, Squarepusher, Holly, Machinedrum, and FaltyDL.
In recent years, beyond AI applications, he has been pursuing expressions that hybridize life and machinery, through collaborations with neuroscientists to visualize and sonify synesthesia, and with life intelligence researchers to incorporate neural cells into artworks. He has developed "PolyNodes," a three-dimensional audio generative software that advances Xenakis's research using contemporary technology, and built original biofeedback systems, making technological development itself an essential part of his creative practice.
From his early experiences as a hip-hop DJ to his current fusion with cutting-edge biotechnology, he continues to maintain an experimental and innovative stance, pioneering a unique expressive domain that transcends the boundaries of art, technology, and science.

### Willie Dixon: The Blues Songwriting Titan

**Biography:**
William James "Willie" Dixon (July 1, 1915 – January 29, 1992) was an American blues musician, singer, songwriter, arranger, and record producer whose influence on modern music is immeasurable. Born in Vicksburg, Mississippi, Dixon grew up in a musically rich environment, exposed to blues, gospel, Dixieland, and ragtime from an early age. One of seven children, he was raised in an integrated neighborhood where his mother ran a small restaurant next to Curley’s Barrelhouse, a venue where he first heard blues legends like Little Brother Montgomery and Charley Patton. This early exposure shaped his lifelong passion for music.

As a teenager, Dixon faced hardships, including stints on Mississippi prison farms, where he was introduced to the raw emotion of blues through work songs. At 17, he left for Chicago in 1936, hitching rides on freight trains. Standing at an imposing 6 feet 6 inches and over 250 pounds, Dixon briefly pursued boxing, winning the Illinois State Golden Gloves Heavyweight Championship (Novice Division) in 1937. However, music soon took precedence. He learned vocal harmony from Theo Phelps, a carpenter who led the Union Jubilee Singers, a gospel quintet in Vicksburg where Dixon sang bass, and began adapting his poetry into songs.

Dixon’s music career took off in Chicago. In the late 1930s, he formed the Five Breezes with Leonard "Baby Doo" Caston, who introduced him to the bass with a makeshift oil-can instrument. After a brief imprisonment in 1940 for refusing military service as a conscientious objector, Dixon resumed his career post-World War II with the Four Jumps of Jive and later the Big Three Trio in 1946. The trio, known for its tight harmonies, brought a polished sound to the blues and enjoyed success with hits like “You Sure Look Good to Me.”

In 1948, Dixon joined Chess Records, initially as a session bassist, and by 1951 became a full-time employee. His tenure at Chess cemented his legacy as the architect of the Chicago blues sound. A prolific songwriter, he penned over 500 compositions, tailoring songs to fit the personas of artists like Muddy Waters, Howlin’ Wolf, Little Walter, and Koko Taylor. His work extended beyond Chess to Cobra Records in the late 1950s, where he produced early hits for Otis Rush, Magic Sam, and Buddy Guy. Dixon also played bass on many of Chuck Berry’s seminal rock-and-roll recordings, bridging blues and the emerging genre.

In the 1960s, Dixon helped internationalize the blues, touring Europe with the American Folk Blues Festival and collaborating with British rock acts like the Rolling Stones and Cream, who covered his songs. As soul music overshadowed blues in the U.S., Dixon’s health declined due to diabetes, leading to the amputation of a leg in the 1980s. He founded the Blues Heaven Foundation in 1982 to preserve the blues legacy and secure royalties for exploited musicians. Dixon died of heart failure on January 29, 1992, in Burbank, California, leaving behind a monumental catalog and a posthumous induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1994.

**Long Description:**
Willie Dixon’s contribution to music is best understood through his dual role as a creative force and a cultural advocate. Often called the “poet laureate of the blues,” Dixon’s songs—like “Hoochie Coochie Man,” “I Just Want to Make Love to You,” “Little Red Rooster,” “My Babe,” and “Spoonful”—are cornerstones of the Chicago blues sound, characterized by electrified instrumentation, bold vocals, and gritty storytelling rooted in Southern Black mythology. His ability to craft lyrics with universal resonance and melodies that stuck made his work a goldmine for artists across genres. Muddy Waters’ swaggering “Hoochie Coochie Man” became a defining anthem, while Howlin’ Wolf’s renditions of “Spoonful” and “Back Door Man” exuded raw power, all thanks to Dixon’s pen.

Beyond songwriting, Dixon was a multi-instrumentalist, proficient on upright bass and guitar, and a producer who shaped the sound of Chess Records during its 1950s peak. His basslines underpinned classics like Chuck Berry’s “Johnny B. Goode,” subtly linking blues to rock and roll. His tenure at Cobra Records further showcased his versatility, nurturing a new generation of blues talent. Dixon’s influence reached its zenith in the 1960s when British Invasion bands—Led Zeppelin, the Rolling Stones, Cream—covered his songs, sometimes sparking legal battles, as with Led Zeppelin’s “Whole Lotta Love,” which borrowed heavily from Dixon’s “You Need Love.”

Dixon’s later years were marked by his advocacy through the Blues Heaven Foundation, reflecting his belief that “the blues are the roots and the other musics are the fruits.” His autobiography, *I Am the Blues* (1989), and the Grammy-winning album *Hidden Charms* (1988) encapsulate his legacy as a tireless champion of the genre. Dixon’s music remains a living testament to the blues’ enduring power, influencing everyone from rock legends to modern hip-hop producers sampling his beats.

### Dixon (Steffen Berkhahn): The House and Techno Visionary

**Biography:**
Dixon, born Steffen Berkhahn on December 21, 1975, in Anklam, East Germany, is a German DJ, producer, and label founder who has redefined house and techno music. Raised in East Berlin, Berkhahn initially dreamed of becoming a professional footballer or long-distance runner, ambitions cut short by injury. In the early 1990s, as Germany reunified, he found his calling in Berlin’s burgeoning club scene, adopting the moniker “Dixon” and DJing at iconic venues like Turbine, Tresor, E-Werk, and WMF. His weekly residency at WMF with Mitja Prinz was a formative experience, honing his skills in long, immersive sets.

Dixon’s global rise began in the 2000s. In 2005, he co-founded Innervisions with Kristian Beyer and Frank Wiedemann of Âme, a Berlin-based label that became a beacon for emotive, vocal-driven house music. His reputation soared as he topped Resident Advisor’s Top 100 DJ Poll from 2013 to 2016, the poll’s final years. Beyond music, Dixon ventured into fashion with Together We Dance Alone in 2017 and launched Transmoderna in 2019, an Ibiza residency and digital platform blending music, art, and technology. Today, he remains a towering figure in electronic music, known for his genre-bending remixes and transcendent live performances.

**Long Description:**
Dixon’s artistry lies in his ability to weave past and future into a singular dancefloor experience. Emerging from Berlin’s post-Wall techno renaissance, he built his reputation on technical precision and stylistic versatility, traits honed during marathon residencies at clubs like Tresor and WMF. Unlike many DJs reliant on pre-mixed sets, Dixon’s approach is organic—hours spent curating tracks, planning set structures, and adapting to crowds in real time. His sound evolved from deep house to a broader palette, incorporating vocals, drama, and grand emotions, a shift credited with reviving Berlin’s dance scene after years of minimal techno dominance.

Innervisions, co-founded in 2005, became Dixon’s creative nucleus. The label’s releases—like Henrik Schwarz, Âme, and Dixon’s collaborative EPs—married soulful melodies with pulsating beats, earning critical acclaim. His remixes, from Femi Kuti’s “Victim of Life” (2000) to Depeche Mode’s “Cover Me” (2017) and LCD Soundsystem’s “I Used To” (2018), showcase his knack for reimagining tracks across genres. Dixon’s sets often feature unreleased Innervisions cuts, keeping his performances exclusive and unpredictable.

His ventures beyond music reflect a holistic vision of nightlife culture. Together We Dance Alone, launched with Ana Ofak, redefines clubwear with futuristic designs, collaborating with brands like Sacai. Transmoderna, initially hosted at Pacha Ibiza and later DC-10, fuses physical events with digital innovation, including mixed-reality streams during the COVID-19 era. Dixon’s influence extends to fashion runways (Givenchy, Louis Vuitton) and even video games, with a 3D-modeled version of himself in *Grand Theft Auto V*’s 2018 expansion. His performances—safe yet thrilling—embody a balance that has made him a global icon in electronic music.

### Don Dixon: The Jangle Pop Architect

**Biography:**
Don Alan Dixon (born December 13, 1950) is an American record producer, songwriter, and musician pivotal to the jangle pop movement of the 1980s. Born in Lancaster, South Carolina, Dixon picked up the bass guitar in junior high, drawn to its control, and taught himself upright bass after buying a Danelectro Silvertone from Sears. At 15, he made his first recording with jazz musician Louis McGloughn in Charlotte, North Carolina. He sang in church and later attended the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.

Dixon spent 13 years with Arrogance, a North Carolina band that pioneered independent music in the 1970s, producing their six albums. In 1982, he co-produced R.E.M.’s debut *Murmur* and follow-up *Reckoning* with Mitch Easter, cementing his reputation. He went solo in 1983, releasing albums like *Most of the Girls Like to Dance but Only Some of the Boys Like To* (1985), while producing acts like The Smithereens and Marshall Crenshaw. After a near-miss producing Nirvana’s *Nevermind*, Dixon continued blending pop craftsmanship with eclectic influences into the 1990s and beyond.

**Long Description:**
Don Dixon’s career is a tapestry of production mastery and melodic songwriting. With Arrogance, he helped forge a Southern music scene, pushing original music into clubs and releasing albums independently—a bold move in the pre-digital era. His production breakthrough came with R.E.M., where he and Easter preserved the band’s quirky charm on *Murmur* and *Reckoning*, adding subtle layers like found sounds and tape effects to elevate their jangle pop sound. This approach—intuitive, not overcalculated—defined his style, seen in later work with The Smithereens, Fetchin Bones, and Guadalcanal Diary.

As a solo artist, Dixon’s music channels classic pop with a twist. His debut *Most of the Girls Like to Dance* (1985) brims with Nick Lowe-esque wit, while *Romeo at Juilliard* (1987) echoes Big Star’s power pop. Albums like *EEE* (1989) and *Romantic Depressive* (1995) reveal a range from upbeat hooks to introspective depth. Though he missed producing *Nevermind* due to budget disputes, Dixon’s influence on alternative rock is undeniable. His hands-on, artist-centric approach—nurturing eccentricity over commercial polish—remains a hallmark of his enduring legacy in American music.

Bio
Dee Diggs bares her soul and loses her inhibitions when she touches those DJ decks. When she plays, she let’s it all show: all the digging
for deep cuts & recall of tracks with that certain ‘je ne sais quoi’ or emotional snag to them. She transmits the pure joy that comes from
the private practice of devotional appreciation of music.
Dee Diggs is a DJ and so much more in Brooklyn, NY. She is unapologetically black, queer, and a lifelong student of the tenets of House
Music. She was born in 1994, a beautiful year for house music. So while she wasn’t at any of the seminal parties or clubs, the spirit is in
her. What started as a hobby in her college radio days in Boston has transformed into a lifestyle of traveling, raving, and seeking of
spiritual connects through sound.
These pursuits shine through in her ability to build adventurous, energetic, seductive, & rapturous sets spanning many genres. An ear for
beauty and nostalgia with a penchant for surprise is what makes her a standout. Every set or mix reminds us to thank the ORIGINAL Black
American Innovators of House & Techno! Thank the Queens & Queers alike for the theatrics & fanfare of nightlife and club culture as we
know it! There are homages to these origins alluded to in her taste and her work as an event curator.
One of Diggs’ first notable DJ mixes was her mix for FACT Magazine released in March 2019 and charted on Pitchfork’s and Resident
Advisors’ own Best Mixes of 2019 lists. It cut an arch through dance music’s past and present to convey an interesting melding of Dee’s
signature sounds lyrical storied tracks, sensual club edits, soulful realness, sneaky grooves, passionate thumpers, and nostalgic endings.
The demand for Diggs as a headliner has grown in the USA's underground network of clubs and parties. Sometimes she crosses the ocean
to bring the black girl magic to Europe as well.
Based in New York, her eponymous party, House of Diggs debuted in February 2020 to stir and settle the hearts of all the lovers of house,
funk, soul, disco, and R&B in Brooklyn. In 2021, she resumed curating House of Diggs as an event series held at Jupiter Disco, a rotary-
focused intimate dance floor in Bushwick. Now, she also holds a DJ residency at a hi-fi nightclub in Gowanus, NY named Public Records.
Diggs is still giving her all in these DJ sets, and has been working on her music production chops in her studio in Queens, NY as well. So

techno.', 'https://irjubpjnvgdhlyzigdpn.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/MySonar%20Videos//Elkka.mp4', 'UK', '03:00:00', '04:00:00', 'Emma Kirby, known professionally as Elkka, is a Welsh-born, London-based musician, producer, DJ, and label founder whose innovative approach to electronic music has made her a standout figure in the contemporary dance music scene. Born in 1988 in Cardiff, Wales, Elkka’s journey into music began with an early love for pop and R&B, inspired by icons like Britney Spears, the Spice Girls, Rihanna, and soulful songstresses such as Joni Mitchell and Annie Lennox. Initially aspiring to become a pop vocalist and songwriter, she spent her early career behind the scenes, navigating the music industry as a hired pen for other artists. However, after years of feeling creatively constrained, she made a pivotal shift in 2016, stepping into the roles of producer and performer—a move that would define her career and artistic identity.

Elkka’s music is a vibrant fusion of house, electronica, breakbeats, and UK bass, often layered with dreamy vocals and percussive rhythms that reflect her intuitive and genre-defying style. Her sound is both euphoric and introspective, blending the warmth of classic house with experimental edges, creating tracks that resonate on the dancefloor and within the listener’s inner world. This distinctive approach stems from her desire to craft music that feels deeply personal, a quality she attributes to her rejection of “sonically cold” compositions in favor of those that evoke connection and emotion.

Before her rise as a solo artist, Elkka endured years of frustration as a pop songwriter, working in studios where she felt her creative control was limited. A turning point came when she attended a Jamie xx concert with her partner, an experience that sparked an epiphany: she wanted to produce her own music. The next day, she began teaching herself production techniques—sample manipulation, side-chaining, filtering—unlocking a newfound sense of liberation. This DIY ethos carried over into her broader career, leading her to found *femme culture* in 2016 alongside her partner, Alex Lambert (known as Ludo). The London-based label and collective was born out of a mission to champion women and queer artists in the arts, fostering inclusivity across all genders, backgrounds, and beliefs. Through *femme culture*, Elkka has released her own music, organized queer club nights, and curated the annual *HeForShe* compilation, with proceeds supporting U.N. Women, featuring artists like Octo Octa, Anz, and DJ Python.

Elkka’s discography reflects her evolution from songwriter to dance music innovator. Her early releases, such as the 2016 EP *HER*, laid the groundwork for her sound, but it was her 2019 EP *Every Body Is Welcome*—released via *femme culture*—that marked her emergence as a force in electronic music. The EP explored themes of self-discovery and community on the dancefloor, a recurring motif in her work as a queer artist finding her place in the world. In 2020, her single “I Miss Raving” (Local Action) captured the collective longing for nightlife during the pandemic, earning praise for its effervescent, pop-infused house vibes. Her breakthrough came in 2021 with the release of *Euphoric Melodies* on Ninja Tune’s Technicolour imprint, a five-track EP blending house and electronica that showcased her knack for crafting emotionally charged dance music. Later that year, *Harmonic Frequencies* further solidified her reputation, earning her the prestigious BBC Radio 1 Essential Mix of the Year award—a career-defining moment that spotlighted her radiant sound to a global audience.

Her success continued to snowball. In August 2021, Elkka won the Association of Independent Music award for Best Independent Remix for her rework of Ela Minus’s “Megapunk,” and she was nominated for Best Breakthrough Producer at the DJ Mag Awards. By April 2022, she became a BBC Radio 1 Resident DJ, joining the likes of Ben UFO and TSHA, a testament to her growing influence. Her live performances—whether expansive DJ sets or hypnotic live shows—have taken her to major festivals like Glastonbury, All Points East, Sonar, and Portola, and she’s supported acts like Caribou and Jon Hopkins on tour. In 2023, she curated a *DJ-Kicks* mix, weaving together Chicago house, disco, techno, and UK bass, with exclusive tracks from herself and collaborators like Herbert and Breaka, further cementing her status as a tastemaker.

Elkka’s debut album, *Prism of Pleasure* (released June 2024 via Ninja Tune), represents the fullest expression of her artistry to date. Written over 18 months, the album delves into themes of empowerment, vulnerability, and sensuality, reflecting her identity as a bold, queer woman. Tracks like “Make Me” juxtapose heavy beats with syrupy vocal samples, while “Right Here”—written in just 40 minutes on the day of her father’s funeral—offers a raw, bittersweet dancefloor catharsis. The album prominently features her own vocals, a departure from her earlier reluctance to foreground her singing, signaling a deeper connection with her audience. This shift was inspired by live performances where singing directly to crowds—like during “Break All My Walls Down”—created an electric intimacy.

Beyond her music, Elkka’s personal journey informs her work. Raised in South Wales with little exposure to a queer community, she pieced together her identity over time, finding herself after coming out and moving to London in her 20s. Her marriage to Alexandra in early 2023 added a layer of personal fulfillment that echoes in her music’s themes of love and connection. As she continues to push boundaries—whether through her productions, *femme culture*, or her advocacy for underrepresented voices in dance music—Elkka remains a dynamic force, blending underground

Hailing from London, Emerald is a self-taught DJ and broadcaster, who from a young age harnessed her perceptive knack for record-digging to build and refine a portfolio of selections that quickly became her own.
Since her debut on Rinse FM in 2014, Emerald’s journey through the airwaves has seen her hosting her own daily Drivetime broadcast to a specialist radio show and now heading up Rinse FM’s flagship Friday night Electronic show ‘The Dance Show’. The show has received acclaim from inside and outside the genre with peers and listeners alike singing the show's praises. Her journey on radio has further cemented her reputation as both a respected tastemaker and a favoured presenter/ broadcaster.
Speaking at and hosting panel shows including ADE Pro, AVA Festival, ‘Women in Business’ & Smirnoff’s ‘Equalising Music’ campaign, her interviewing skills have also landed her conversations with M.I.A, The Internet, Skream, HAAI, Chase & Status, Black Coffee and many, many more.
Placing focus on championing the unsung heroes of the underground and grassroots dance communities across the UK, Emerald has performed in renowned spaces such as Printworks, The Warehouse Project, Glastonbury Festival, fabric, Lollapalooza and alongside this promoted her own club night & DJ Mag Award-nominated live stream ‘Afters with Emerald’.
Legendary London club space Corsica Studios recently invited Emerald to become a resident at the venue, the South London institution is the perfect space for Emerald to showcase her aesthetic as she plays extended sets and curates’ lineups.
In 2024 Emerald turns the page on a new chapter in her career as an artist as she delivers her debut EP to the world via DJ Haus’ label UTTU, the music has been exceptionally well received with plays coming from key DJs & tastemakers.
Her musical style is best described as “genre-fluid”.

With a career spanning over two decades, Prydz has become a pivotal figure in the progressive house genre, known for his meticulous production style, innovative live performances, and an array of aliases that showcase his versatility. His discography includes iconic tracks like "Call on Me," "Pjanoo," and "Opus," which have cemented his status as a trailblazer in the global dance music scene.

### Early Life and Musical Beginnings
Growing up in a suburb of Stockholm, Prydz developed an early interest in music, influenced by the burgeoning electronic sounds of the 1980s and 1990s. As a teenager, he was drawn to the works of artists like Depeche Mode and Kraftwerk, which sparked his curiosity in synthesizers and drum machines. Rather than pursuing formal musical training, Prydz taught himself how to produce music using rudimentary equipment, honing his craft in his bedroom. His passion for creating beats and melodies quickly set him apart from his peers, and by his early twenties, he was already making waves in Stockholm’s underground club scene.

### Rise to Fame
Prydz’s breakthrough came in 2004 with the release of "Call on Me," a track released under his own name that became a global phenomenon. Sampling Steve Winwood’s 1982 hit "Valerie," the song paired a catchy vocal hook with an infectious house beat, dominating charts worldwide and peaking at No. 1 in the UK Singles Chart. The track’s provocative music video, featuring a risqué aerobics class, further amplified its cultural impact, though Prydz himself has often distanced himself from its commercial sheen, preferring to focus on his deeper, more progressive works.

While "Call on Me" brought him mainstream attention, Prydz was already establishing himself in the underground scene under various aliases. His alter ego **Pryda**, launched in 2004, became synonymous with lush, melodic progressive house tracks that appealed to purists. Releases like "Aftermath," "Melo," and "Murmur" showcased his knack for crafting intricate, emotive soundscapes. Another alias, **Cirez D**, emerged as his outlet for darker, techno-driven productions, with tracks like "On Off" and "Knockout" earning him respect among techno aficionados.

### Musical Style and Innovation
Prydz’s sound is characterized by its cinematic quality, blending driving basslines, atmospheric synths, and carefully layered progressions. His productions often feel like journeys, building tension and release over extended runtimes—a trait that distinguishes him from many of his contemporaries. This approach is perhaps best exemplified in his 2016 track "Opus," a nearly nine-minute masterpiece that evolves from ambient beginnings into a euphoric climax, widely regarded as one of his finest works.

Beyond his studio output, Prydz is celebrated for his forward-thinking live performances. In 2011, he debuted his **EPIC (Eric Prydz In Concert)** show, a groundbreaking audiovisual experience that combined cutting-edge visuals with his music. The concept evolved over the years, with iterations like EPIC 4.0 and EPIC 5.0 featuring massive LED screens, holograms, and synchronized lighting, setting a new standard for live EDM spectacles. His 2019 **HOLOSPHERE** show took this ambition further, using a giant spherical structure to immerse audiences in a 360-degree sensory experience.

### Career Milestones and Labels
In 2008, Prydz released "Pjanoo," a piano-driven house anthem that became another signature track, peaking at No. 2 in the UK and earning widespread acclaim. Its uplifting melody and timeless appeal have made it a staple in his live sets and a favorite among fans. That same year, he founded **Pryda Recordings**, a label dedicated to releasing his own music and that of like-minded artists. The label’s sub-imprint, **Pryda Presents**, and his techno-focused **Mouseville Records** (for Cirez D releases) further expanded his creative empire.

Prydz’s debut artist album, **Opus**, arrived in 2016 under Virgin Records, a double-disc effort that showcased his range—from the progressive house of the title track to the experimental "Klepht." While he has historically favored singles and EPs over full-length albums, *Opus* was a critical and commercial success, debuting at No. 1 on the Billboard Dance/Electronic Albums chart.

### Personal Life and Legacy
Despite his global fame, Prydz remains a relatively private figure. He has spoken candidly about his aversion to flying, which has limited his touring schedule, particularly in the United States. Instead, he often opts for residencies, such as his long-running shows in Ibiza and Las Vegas, where he can deliver his elaborate productions to dedicated audiences. This phobia has also fueled his reputation as a perfectionist who prioritizes quality over quantity, often spending months refining a single track.

Prydz’s influence extends beyond his own music. He has inspired a generation of producers with his genre-blending approach and commitment to artistic integrity, resisting the pressure to conform to EDM’s more commercial trends. Collaborations with artists like Deadmau5 (under their joint "Pryda Friends" banner) and remixes for acts like CHVRCHES and Calvin Harris highlight his versatility and respect within the industry.

### Recent Work and Future
As of April 2025, Prydz continues to push boundaries. His recent releases under Pryda and Cirez D, along with sporadic live shows, demonstrate that he remains at the peak of his creative powers. Rumors of a second album persist, though Prydz has kept details under wraps, true to his enigmatic persona. Whether in the studio or on stage, Eric Prydz’s legacy as a visionary in electronic music is undeniable—a Swedish maestro whose beats resonate across continents and generations.A brand-new set from the progressive house super-producer and undisputed ‘king of the drop’ At this point, Eric Prydz needs no introduction.

Flore is a leading figure in the French bass scene, known for her prowess as a DJ, producer, curator, and label boss of POLAAR. Her energy-filled DJ sets and ability to create a sense of community on the dance floor are what sets her apart. With a passion for a variety of musical styles, Flore seamlessly blends amen-breaks, Afro-Caribbean influences, acid house, and techno. As a resident of Sucre in Lyon, she showcases her impressive musical selections, consistently delivering well-curated and distinctive sets, characterized by syncopated bassdrums, explosive basslines, and intense percussions.

In 2020, Flore released her second album, RITUALS, on her own label POLAAR. This album distinguishes itself by Flore's unique approach to bass music and her eagerness to break down genre barriers. RITUALS caught the attention of numerous DJs and media outlets, both nationally and internationally, including BBC, Mixmag, Trax, and Tsugi. Following the album's success, Flore has released several eps that have made a strong impression, such as Legacy & Broken Pieces - released in May 2022 - or more recently « Base IQ » released on Peder Mannerfelt's PM+ label. These highly noticed releases earned her an invitation to record a mix for the Dekmantel collection (Best mix of the week on Resident Advisor when it came out) and recently a Boiler Room mix.

Flore's passion for technology as a means to escape the confines of conventional music genres has led her to explore new esthetics and stage setups. In recent years, she has worked closely with the visual artist WSK to create immersive live shows that combine music and 360-degree video mapping. She is also increasingly interested in multiple-speaker diffusion and is actually working on a dome project. Her expertise in this area earned her the distinction of becoming the first certified female Ableton instructor in France. As a result, she is frequently invited to collaborate on various projects, such as the live performance "inBach" with the musician Arandel (inFiné) and a joint creation with the Musée de la Musique's collection of rare and valuable instruments.

Emerging from the vibrant UK underground music scene, Hamdi has become a standout figure in electronic music, particularly within the realms of dubstep, bass, and grime. His journey into music began at a young age, with an interest in production sparking when he was just 12 years old. Initially drawn to the raw energy of grime, he later expanded his sonic palette, incorporating influences from dubstep pioneers like Skrillex and Flux Pavilion. By his late teens, after turning 18, Hamdi dove headfirst into DJing and producing, quickly establishing himself as a force to be reckoned with.

Over the past decade, Hamdi has honed his craft, blending genres with a loose, intuitive approach that keeps his music fresh and unpredictable. His career gained significant traction through consistent EP releases and a series of well-received free downloads on SoundCloud, which helped him build a loyal following in the UK. His breakthrough came in 2022 with the release of "Skanka," a dubstep track that exploded onto the global scene, earning praise as one of the genre’s defining anthems of the year. This success catapulted him from a UK underground staple to an internationally recognized artist, performing at major festivals and venues across Australia, India, and the United States.

Baligh Hamdi – Egyptian Composer
Biography

Baligh Hamdi (October 7, 1931 – September 12, 1993) was an Egyptian composer whose work left an indelible mark on Arabic music, particularly during the mid-20th century. Born Baligh Abdel Hamid Hamdi Morsi in the Shubra district of Cairo, he grew up in an intellectually rich household—his father was a physics professor at King Fuad I University (now Cairo University). From an early age, Hamdi displayed a natural affinity for music, beginning violin lessons at nine and later mastering the oud, a traditional Arabic lute, in his early teens. His formal music education came through private lessons with various teachers, though he briefly pursued law studies before abandoning them to follow his true passion.

Hamdi’s professional career took off in 1954 at the age of 22, initially as a singer, before he shifted his focus to composition. His big break came in the late 1950s when the legendary Umm Kulthum, one of the Arab world’s most iconic vocalists, chose his composition "El Hob Eih" for her repertoire, catapulting him to fame. Throughout the 1960s and 1970s, he became one of the most prolific and sought-after composers in the Arab world, creating timeless hits for stars like Abdel Halim Hafez, Warda Al-Jazairia (whom he married for a decade), Fayza Ahmed, and Mayada El Hennawy. His personal life, including his high-profile marriage to Warda, often intertwined with his music, adding emotional depth to his compositions.

Long Description

Baligh Hamdi’s musical legacy is defined by his extraordinary ability to blend traditional Egyptian melodies with modern orchestration, revitalizing Arabic pop and folk music during a golden era of cultural renaissance in the Arab world. His compositions are celebrated for their emotional resonance, intricate arrangements, and innovative use of both Eastern and Western musical elements. Drawing inspiration from Egypt’s rich musical heritage—spanning folk traditions, classical qasidas, and patriotic themes—Hamdi crafted songs that spoke to the hearts of millions, transcending borders and generations.

His collaborations were legendary. With poet Muhammad Hamzah, he produced classics like "Gana El Hawa" and "Zay El Hawa," while his partnership with Abdel Rahman el-Abnudi and singer Mohamed Rushdie introduced a wave of Egyptian folk-inspired hits such as "Adaweya" and "Tayer Ya-hwa." Hamdi’s work with Warda, including songs like "Batwannes Beik" and "Bawadaak" (written for her before his death), showcased his ability to tailor compositions to a singer’s unique voice, amplifying their emotional impact. His patriotic songs, such as "Ya Habibty Ya Masr" and "Ash Elly Kal," reflected his deep love for Egypt, often performed by himself in his early career.

Beyond pop, Hamdi contributed significantly to musical theater, composing operettas like "Egypt Bride" and "Tmarahnp," and he played a key role in discovering talents like Afaf Radi.

gothic elements, and punk rock DIY ethos. With a global touring history, she’s a staple at venues like Spybar and Soundbar, known for her unique edge in the techno scene.', 'https://irjubpjnvgdhlyzigdpn.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/MySonar%20Videos//Hiroko_Yamamura.mp4', 'US', '01:00:00', '02:00:00', 'Classic Chicago ride or die style DJ/producer influenced by The Warehouse, technology, and
straight up techno, it’s no wonder she has been named one of Chicago’s top 10 DJ’s by XLR8R
magazine.
Technology and exploration are at the roots of Hiroko’s core. Equally enthralled by the beat and
the machines generating them, her sound is an homage to every circuit, resistor, patch cord
and application that brings voice and inspiration to her work. Her gothic and industrial roots are
evident in her music, as well as her punk rock DIY drive. Taking inspiration from classic science
fiction and dark anime, Hiroko’s studio can often be confused for a booth at a comic
convention.
Currently calling labels such as Trax Records, Impact Mechanics, Slap Jaxx and Klectik as
home, she just recently returned from a long hiatus from music. Her previous projects under
the Bio-Booster and as a member of Monologic have not ceased, however they have taken a
back seat to a more focused techno vision. As a midwest rave staple, Hiroko has toured the
globe spreading the sounds of Chicago including gigs at the famed Detroit Movement Festival
as well as regular Berlin and Ibiza shows. Hiroko currently calls clubs such as Spybar and
Soundbar home. She actively contributes jacking Chicago techno with an edge all its own,
along with her like-minded colleagues and collaborators including Heartthrob, Seth Troxler,

roots.', 'https://irjubpjnvgdhlyzigdpn.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/MySonar%20Videos//Interplanetary_Criminal.mp4', 'UK', '00:00:00', '02:00:00', 'Interplanetary Criminal is the Manchester-based producer, DJ and ATW Records co-founder
leading a rip-roaring new wave of UK garage. Straight from the studio to the iconic Arcadia
spider, and from Dekmantel to Depot Mayfield, Croatia, Bogotá, Sydney, Miami and all-nighters
at Leeds’ beloved Wire, IPC and his speedy, rowdy sets – and speedier, rowdier productions –
are connecting with up-for-it audiences. His formula? Fresh, fun and foundation-minded,
balancing innovation with a wholehearted appreciation for everything that’s come before,
including the enduring influence of the North West.
His dedication is paying oﬀ. Recent years have seen IPC (real name Zach Bruce) earn DJ Mag’s
Best of British awards for Best Producer and Best T rack, along with a Brit Award nomination.
He’s played ecstatic b2bs with legends like Skream, remixed for formative heroes like Dusky
and been a regular on Rinse FM. Not to mention all the music he’s created and shared, counting
2022’s celebratory “All Thru The Night” V/A compilation for the seminal Locked On label. Plus, of
course, the chart-topping “B.O.T.A. (Baddest Of Them All)” – an irresistible collab with Eliza
Rose. He’s been on a collaboration tip this year as well, releasing the sing-along, 00s-flavoured
“No Time” (featuring Canadian artist SadBoi) and the icy, 2-step-meets-drill “Races” (with
Harlem Spartans founder Blanco) via Room T wo Recordings. And in the afterglow of another
packed festival season, he’s just wrapped up a North and South American tour. The UK and
Europe are next, with IPC’s hotly-tipped headline show at London’s HERE @ Outernet selling
out in hours. It’s going to be a massive club autumn/winter.
Perfectly aligned, then, with his new solo EP for ATW Records, which he launched in 2020
alongside Danish artist (and kindred spirit) Main Phase. If you were to ask IPC to describe
“ATW007,” he’d say it’s “no-nonsense, brash, rudeboy energy,” primed for club usage and
crafted specifically for his USB. The EP features an incendiary link-up with veteran MC Riko Dan
(“Gunman”), IPC’s go-to set opener (“The Valley”) and a “classic speed garage” love letter to his
hometown (“Manchester” – of course). Listening to it is like being plunged into a peak-time
dancefloor, not just in how it sounds but in how it makes you feel – pulled into a crowd, locked
in a groove, in the thick of something special.
This new EP (much like IPC’s output at large) is dedicated to the underground, which makes
total sense. When it comes to IPC personally – but also UKG more broadly – context and
authenticity are everything. ATW Records champions that, aiming to capture the energy and

Jayda G, the Grammy-nominated writer, producer, DJ, environmental toxicologist, campaigner and broadcaster, returned with her new full length album ‘Guy’, in June 2023 on Ninja Tune. Drawing on her House, Disco, RnB & Soul roots, the tracks are interlaced with archival recordings of her late father, the eponymous William Richard Guy, that form the bedrock of the album’s narrative, capturing a small snapshot of the American experience told through the eyes of a young African American man.

The album arrives on the back of a busy few years that have seen her Grammy-nominated for her mid-pandemic single “Both Of Us”, created with producer Fred again..; release a trove of high-profile remixes for the likes of Taylor Swift & Dua Lipa; tour the world’s biggest festival stages including Glastonbury & Coachella; release a compilation for the renowned DJ Kicks series; appear as a guest judge on BBC’s ‘Glow Up’; and contribute to the immersive climate-focussed installation ‘Undercurrent’ alongside artists like Khruangbin, Nosaj Thing, Mount Kimbie and Bon Iver. 

She has recently embarked on a life changing journey whilst undertaking filming for the forthcoming feature-length documentary ‘Blue Carbon’, which took her to the front lines of the climate crisis to meet with those communities already affected by the looming catastrophe.

L'Miranda y Candadismo son dos artistas multidisciplinarios que fusionan sus raíces
latinoamericanas y andaluzas con lo más vanguardista de la música electrónica global. Ambos
residentes en Barcelona y miembros clave del colectivo Deprerreo, exploran y expanden las
fronteras de los sonidos urbanos y de club.
L'Miranda, DJ y productor Venezolano, se caracteriza por su habilidad para mezclar bass
music, breaks y ritmos tropicales, creando un sonido lleno de técnica, ironía y emoción. Como
co-fundador de Deprerreo, ha sido fundamental en la promoción del nuevo sonido
latinoamericano en distintos escenarios y plataformas a nivel mundial.
Candadismo, DJ, cantante y artista visual Andaluza, lleva su enfoque experimental a través de
géneros como el flamenco, deconstructed club y latincore, explorando la sensualidad y lo
absurdo en el sonido, mientras fusiona nostalgia y modernidad.
Juntos, L'Miranda B2B Candadismo ofrecen una experiencia sonora donde los contrastes y la
fusión de géneros se convierten en la clave. Un set impredecible, lleno de momentos de pura

Spain, and Bahia, Brazil, Lua de Santana is a 23-year-old Grammy-
nominated multidisciplinary artist who has been making significant waves in the music
industry. After studying vocals, music composition, and music business in London, UK,
she recently relocated to Madrid, Spain, where she is independently developing her
highly anticipated debut project.
Lua's artistry is deeply influenced by legends such as Nina Simone, Aaliyah, and
Beyoncé, culminating in a sound she describes as “honest.” Her fluid musicality and
deeply personal lyrics have garnered critical acclaim. Notably, Pitchfork highlighted her
EP "GINGA," comparing her innovative style to that of Arca and Björk, while emphasizing
its dance-inducing quality. In July 2024, Lua was featured in Pitchfork Selects' playlist,
further cementing her status as an emerging artist to watch.
Notably, her collaboration with Nathy Peluso on the track "MENINA," featured on
Peluso's 2024 album GRASA, showcases her dynamic range. This track was later
remixed by Grammy-winning British producer Mura Masa, further highlighting Lua's
versatility.
Embracing her heritage, Lua aims to infuse her work with her cultural richness while

Almost certainly the only working electronic artist with a PhD in computational biology, he’s spent 15 years using his scientific background to dream up shows that bridge the gaps between clubs, concert halls, and art galleries. A constant innovator, he’s long been inspired by the natural world, scientific phenomena, and mathematical models. But on latest album On Being , due out in February 2025, he flipped the script, instead using thousands of anonymous quotes from his fans as inspiration. To accompany the record, he’s preparing a brand new live AV show - entitled ‘ Lattice 3D/AV ’ - featuring some exciting new additions to his arsenal. More information to come as soon as we have it.Biography: Max Cooper

Max Cooper is an electronic composer, multi-disciplinary artist, music label founder and former scientist who has carved out a unique space in music and visual art.

He holds a PhD in computational biology at the same time as being the first contemporary electronic musician to perform at the ancient Acropolis theatre in Athens and one of the first clutch of musicians to produce in Dolby Atmos.

Cooper has enquired for over 15 years through music, collaborations, and his label Mesh, to explore the intersections between the arts and sciences with installations, performances, immersive experiences, online media, music videos and live events.  Anchored throughout is his emotive approach, connecting how ideas and forms feel, in a manner accessible to us all. 
 
As an artist synonymous with the evolution of club culture, Cooper honed his craft as a DJ with a 10-year residency at legendary Midlands techno event Firefly where he formed a foundational relationship with Architecture Social Club, with whom he still collaborates on extravagant immersive installations.

"I want to encourage the acceptance of electronic music as an art form like any other. Bringing electronic music and abstract audio-visual projects into concert halls, museums and galleries is liberating - the art world opens up doors to communicate in ways that aren’t possible elsewhere."
 
Cooper's newest release On Being, an exploration of the "desperate experience of being human", is his tenth studio album. Crafted over two years, gathering thousands of anonymous quotes to use as creative fuel, this is Cooper's first attempt to use the experiences of his audience as inspiration for his music - rather than attempting to influence his audience's experiences with his music. "I hadn't realised the impact that other people's words would have on me."
 
Pivoting from computational biology to electronic music might not seem like the most natural career transition, but for Cooper the commonalities are obvious:
 
"In both fields, you're in a sense, free. Free from the limits of living systems, free from the limits of corporeal sound. The only constraints are in your mind."

only 26 years of age she has performed in important events of the
national and international scene such as: Primavera Sound, Apolo,
Nitsa, Fuego Razzmatazz, Boiler Room, Rototom, Pacha Ibiza, Antidoto,
Voodoo Club, Native Soundsystem (London), Dengo Club (Lisbon), La
Discoteca, Kanaal40 (Amsterdam), Gonzo (Zurich) and for brands
such as Adidas, Nike, Netflix, Loewe, Mugler, H&M, Raya, Bimba&Lola,
Bershka, Colors Studios, among others. She has shared stage with
artists like Shygirl, Lil Tecca, Sho Madjozi, Audiocomingsoon, Vivendii
Sound, Moonshine, DJ Playero, Mr Eazi, Abhir Hathi, Israel B and many
more.
Born and raised in Barcelona with Japanese and Spanish roots, Nagui
has a strong connection with the japanese culture from her dad,
which we can see in her first mix called "asekaki odori", a term she
invented translating it as "the sweat dance". As we can understand
from the name of her last mix, one of her main motors as a DJ is that
everyone dances, sweats and enjoys her sets. She is currently working
on monthly releases and exploring new sounds and creating her own
edits.
She started as a DJ in 2019, but with a break in 2020, she has returned
strong and considering it as a profession. This 2024 is going to be a
new edition for her carreer as she will be travelling abroad including
Japan and London.

“Esta ambición me está matando” (“This ambition is killing me”) are the first words Nathy Peluso belts out in “Corleone”, the bold opening track of her new powerful album, GRASA. This phrase sets the tone for this sophomore effort, which reveals a more mature and emboldened Nathy who asserts her unique capabilities as a songwriter and performer, seamlessly navigating rap, ballads, and tropical genres. For the first time, the Argentine-born, Spain-based artist reveals a more intimate and personal side in her lyrics, unafraid to open up about the growing pains and creative crises that come with fame, success and the pressures of modern stardom. 

Nathy co-produced and co-wrote the 15 tracks in the album. Most tracks are the result of a close collaboration with Venezuelan musician and producer Manuel Lara (Kali Uchis, Bad Bunny) who also serves as executive producer with Nathy. ‘GRASA’ draws visual and stylistic inspiration from a diverse array of references - the cinematic grandeur of mafia lore, 1970s NYC salsa, current icons like Kendrick Lamar - but grounded in a contemporary sound. The album feels like the soundtrack of Nathy’s current moment as she pushes boundaries and defies expectations in her craft. It’s also the triumphant result of a deeply personal journey. 

Her critically acclaimed 2020 debut album Calambre catapulted Nathy to fame and success, winning “Best Alternative Album” at the 2021 Latin GRAMMYs, scoring hits with Bizarrap, C Tangana and Tiago PZK, playing Coachella, selling out two Movistar Arenas in Buenos Aires and touring all over Spain. But her signature zeal and grueling work ethic came at a personal cost. In between performing, brand deals and releasing new music, in 2022 and 2023 she quickly got to work in the writing and production of new material that would serve as a follow up album. “It’s rooted in me, I’m a strong woman, but I lost track of my own humanity,” she says of her self-imposed high standards, which coupled with the pressures of the industry, and a series of romantic heartbreaks, compromised her mental health and left her emotionally unfulfilled. “I was like a robot telling myself, ‘I’m a gladiator’. But I had to relearn how to enjoy simple things in life that were not work.”

She credits her mentor and friend, Argentine icon Fito Páez, with helping her find her creative center. Last summer, she decided to take a break and go on a vacation. Nathy and Páez ended up in the same location on vacation, and she confided in him that she felt “so lost.” Nathy arrived at a hard realization: she had to discard the 20 plus tracks that didn’t feel right. She felt she was letting her team and everybody around her down. Páez encouraged her to find a conceptual framework to create new music.“Something so small, so simple ignited something in me and sent me off to focus,” says Nathy. 
 
GRASA is anchored in three musical pillars: hip hop, tropical and ballads and she embodies these different genres with craft, precision and skill. Thematically, is Nathy’s own personal soundtrack with a cinematic velour. She says: “It stems from my private life and my honesty. Previous songs I’ve done have been perhaps more fantastical, I’ve made up imaginary characters…This album is deeply personal.” 
 
Going to therapy and taking time off helped Nathy replenish herself as a person and as an artist, to learn once again how to enjoy the music creation process. “This album takes the learnings of what I went through. I’ve decided to talk about my private life, which is something I had never exposed before,” she says. 

Fans will be delighted to hear Nathy’s rapping in full force across several tracks in GRASA, something she wanted to do more of for them. In “Todo Roto”, featuring Paco Amoroso and Ca7riel, she delivers strong bars and invites listeners on a journey of self-discovery, challenging them to confront their fears and embrace their true selves, along with her.  Another rap, “Aprender a Amar,” is an ode to self-love co-written and co-produced by indie alternative artist pablopablo. “It’s like a mantra I’m telling myself and the whole world,” says Nathy. “It’s essential and you can’t achieve it overnight. It’s work until the day you die.”  
For Nathy, the single “Legendario” is the most powerful track in the album, “In the end, what matters is doing something that lasts, whether it's small or huge, but something in which you feel that you did the best and that remains for your history,” she says.  “I’ve learned to enjoy what I’m most passionate about, which is writing, being an artist, and embrace my own sensibility.” 
 
For Lara, Nathy is on her way to becoming legendary herself. “Legends break the mold, reinvent themselves. Nathy has that.” 
 
Nathy and Lara clicked at the studio and after that, ‘GRASA’ ended up coming together very fast, in three sessions over six weeks at Sony’s 5020 Studios in both Madrid and Miami. “He is committed, hard-working, respectful, and contributes wonderful things all the time. He’s a Maserati,” she says of Lara. Together, they figured out the framework the album needed (the 1983 iconic movie “Scarface” was always playing in the studio as a visual inspiration throughout the sessions). “The album has a tinge of Tarantino-esque violence, of danger, of passion, of breaking the rules, which represents me because I’m very passionate,” says Nathy. She came in with lyrics and was ready to let go and truly collaborate with Lara as well as multi instrumentalist Ben Aller. 
 
“Nathy is like Pandora's box, a mix of so many things. She knows exactly what she wants”, says Lara, who has a degree in Music Engineering and Production from Berklee College of Music. “The way she expresses her ideas lyrically is one of the most amazing things I've ever seen.” Additional production credits include Colombian producer Casta (Karol G, Manuel Turizo), frequent Nathy collaborator Didi Gutman (María José Llergo, Brazilian Girls) and Sony's own Rafael Arcaute.

In Spanish, ‘GRASA’ evokes many different meanings and cultural subtexts, especially in her native Argentina, where the word can mean “tacky”, “tasteless” or “vulgar”. But Nathy, like her music, doesn't want to limit herself to one definition: it could be how she proudly flaunts her body that doesn't fit the mold of heteronormative expectations while publicly revering a slice of pizza or pasta on her social media feeds. Or it could evoke the richness of her musical arrangements, or even her zealous, all-in attitude of getting her hands dirty, in everything she does. She wants to reclaim the word and make it part of her universe: “For me it's a state of mind, a lifestyle,” she says. 
Standout track 'La Presa', marks the third salsa song in Nathy's repertoire, after “Un veneno” in Calambre and single “Mafiosa”. A salsa song in the classic vein of Hector Lavoe or Rubén Blades, “La Presa '' counts with Venezuelan songwriter-producers Servando Primera and Yasmil Morrufo and is blessed with backup vocals by none other than Jerry Rivas, Luisito Carrión and members of El Gran Combo de Puerto Rico. It’s rare to hear a young female artist masterfully and so sumptuously deliver a salsa song from a woman’s point of view. On top of that, Nathy imbues what could be a mere romantic trope with satire and dark humor. 
 
In “Manhattan”, featuring Argentine trap artist Duki, she rises above her haters. It's rare to hear Nathy addressing them fully-on, but again she stays authentic to her experiences of the last four years as part of her raw honesty. Likewise “Envidia”, preceded by an intro from no other than C-Tangana, is also a theatrical, even humorous take on how poisonous society can be. “Humor is what keeps me alive, I swear,” says Nathy about having the last laugh. “God will always give you an opportunity, but it’s up to you whether you take advantage of it or whether you waste your energy worrying about other people's business.”
 
In an industry often characterized by superficiality, Nathy's authenticity shines through, reminding us that you can be an ambitious powerful woman while also showing vulnerability and being open about navigating life’s challenges. 
 
In that vein, “El día que perdí mi juventud,” is a nostalgic acoustic tune reminiscent of Argentine rosarina trova or Argentine rock pioneer Litto Nebbia. It features producer Dev Hynes (who records under the artistic name Blood Orange) on guitar. Nathy and Hynes, who has produced for Solange, Sky Ferreira, recorded it together at his home studio in London. 
 
In ‘GRASA’, Nathy revels in a newfound willingness to delve into her personal experiences and innermost thoughts. She acknowledges the pressures of fame and the relentless pursuit of success, yet remains resilient in her commitment to self-expression.  She goes all in, uncompromising in showing herself vulnerable and the dark side of fame. She can still be a businesswoman but the struggle is also part of the journey. And she shows us her journey. “It never crosses my mind to throw in the towel. Never. But at what cost? I was empty and dead inside, but kept pushing forward. I needed to recover,” she says. “In this album I feel I can tell my story from a healthier perspective, after having healed certain things but sharing everything that took to get here.”

'https://irjubpjnvgdhlyzigdpn.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/MySonar%20Videos//oma_totem.mp4', 'ES', '01:00:00', '03:00:00', 'Oma Totem is a Barcelona-based DJ, producer, and multi-disciplinary artist whose innovative approach to electronic music has earned him a growing reputation in the underground scene. Born Ignasi Sadurní Viñas, Oma Totem’s artistic journey is deeply rooted in the vibrant cultural landscape of Catalonia, where he spent his formative years oscillating between the serene hills of the region and the pulsating nightlife of Barcelona. His moniker, inspired by a sculpture by contemporary artist Danh Vo, reflects his penchant for blending intellectual concepts with visceral, body-moving soundscapes.

Oma Totem’s musical career began around seven years ago when he emerged as a member of the local Barcelona collective Draft. This early involvement provided him with a platform to hone his skills, and he quickly established himself as a resident DJ at the renowned Barcelona club Nitsa. Although he is no longer an active member of Draft, his connection to the city’s music community remains strong, as he continues to organize one-off events and concerts throughout the year.

His discography showcases a versatile and evolving sound that defies easy categorization, drawing from influences as diverse as bass music, techno, dub, and experimental electronics. Oma Totem made his debut in 2023 with the EP *exercicis rítmics* on Hivern Discs, a label helmed by fellow Barcelona artist John Talabot. The release is a hypnotic blend of intricate percussion and trippy textures, embodying his signature style of music that stimulates both the mind and the body. Later that year, he followed up with *wave//constants*, a digital EP featuring digidub-influenced hardware jams derived from his live performances, further showcasing his ability to translate raw energy into recorded form.

In 2024, Oma Totem released *the trick* on Kalahari Oyster Cult, a four-track EP that marked a bold step forward. Moving between bass-heavy rhythms and the more cerebral, psychedelic shades of techno, the project solidified his reputation as a producer capable of crafting dancefloor-ready tracks with an experimental edge. Described as “dubbed up, far out, and cerebral dance music for the small hours,” *the trick* encapsulates his ability to balance accessibility with boundary-pushing creativity.

Beyond his solo work, Oma Totem is a collaborative artist at heart. Since 2022, he has partnered with multidisciplinary artist Juns as part of the experimental multimedia duo *res_és_nostre*. Their debut album, released on Hivern Discs as a cassette accompanied by a book of poetry by Juns, melds haunted samples, field recordings, radical sonics, and spoken word in Catalan. The project reflects their shared commitment to pushing artistic boundaries, and the duo has performed at prestigious venues like Amsterdam’s former De School in 2023, with new material currently in development.

Oma Totem’s live performances are a cornerstone of his artistry. In 2023, he premiered his audiovisual show *s__olids*, created in collaboration with the artist duo Sol i Serps (Crisantos Castella and Juns). The project debuted with two Barcelona dates, including a standout performance at MIRA Festival, blending immersive visuals with his dynamic sound design. His versatility as a live performer has made him a sought-after name in the European electronic music circuit.

When not producing or performing, Ignasi Sadurní Viñas serves as a label manager and collaborator at Hivern Discs, working closely with John Talabot to shape the imprint’s forward-thinking catalog. His dual role as artist and curator underscores his deep investment in the music community, both locally and internationally.

With a monthly listener base of around 486 on Spotify (as of recent data), Oma Totem remains an artist on the rise, celebrated for his ability to weave together intricate rhythms, evocative atmospheres, and a distinctly Catalan sensibility. His work is available across platforms like Bandcamp, Beatport, SoundCloud, and Apple Music, where fans can explore releases like *exercicis rítmics*, *wave//constants*, and *the trick*, as well as collaborative tracks such as “L'empelt” and “Drames Rurals” with Talabot, Juns, and Meritxell Bonastre.

Gambian via Coventry, artist Pa Salieu has soared to unprecedented heights in recent
years. Since he released ‘Frontline’, his debut single in 2020, followed by a critically
acclaimed mixtape, Send Them To Coventry, he has accumulated plaudits of a rarified
air: headlining multiple festivals, receiving co-signs from the likes of the late Virgil Abloh
and Nigerian popstar Burna Boy, and going on to win BBC’s Sound Of… & BRIT’s Critics
Choice nomination.
Now, with his transformative project Afrikan Alien, Pa channels years of introspection,
resilience, and creative rebirth. Written during a period marked by both personal
reflection and systemic barriers, the album is a powerful statement on identity,
freedom, and survival. Diagnosed with ADHD and navigating the complexities of mental
health, Pa’s vulnerability has become his greatest strength, infusing his music with
unfiltered honesty and emotional depth. Songs like Dece and YGF reveal an artist
grappling with—and ultimately embracing—his layered existence, from the cultural
dissonance of straddling two worlds to the enduring spirit that refuses to be confined.

for her eclectic approach
to music. She has mastered the art of captivating dance floors worldwide with her distinct
style and extensive sets that seamlessly blend underground floor-fillers with indefinable
synth house sounds. Beyond her career as a DJ, Paula is committed to a broader artistic
journey, putting the same passion into her music production as she does in her DJ sets.
Paula Tape’s musical path began in the early 2000s when she played drums for indie bands,
sparking her love for polyrhythmic patterns. This percussive foundation is deeply rooted in
her productions, remixes, and DJ sets
Her rise to prominence in the industry wasn’t easy or handed to her . Starting as an
up-and-coming DJ in Chile, Paula relocated to Europe to fully immerse herself in building her
career from the ground up. From djing at underground parties to performing at major
festivals, Paula’s hard work and dedication to sharing her sound have paid off.
Her debut EP , "Agua Congas" on SOBO, gained significant support from key selectors, helping
to establish her unique sound. She has since released music on esteemed labels such as
Rhythm Section, Permanent Vacation, Ransom Note, Planet Trip, and Alzaya. In 2021, Paula
became part of the Rhythm Section family with her track "Panamericana", followed by her
full 4-track EP titled "Astroturismo."
In 2023, Paula was selected by BBC Radio 1 as one of their residents, making her the first
Chilean-born artist on the residency.
In early 2023, Paula Tape introduced Hola Mundo—a global party series that showcases her
distinctive style and sound. With thoughtfully curated lineups featuring a diverse range of
artists, Hola Mundo aims to foster an inclusive atmosphere where people from all
backgrounds can unite through music, dance, and shared experiences, creating a space that
transforms both individual lives and communities.
In 2024, she makes her highly anticipated return to the studio with the "Acid Latino EP ,"
featuring the single "Acid Latino (Sonido Real)," released on Future Classic Records. Another
milestone this year is her debut on BBC Radio 1 with her first Essential Mix, marking a
significant moment in her career .
Paula's artistic direction is influenced by her studies in fashion design, which serve as an
extra source of inspiration for her projects. This unique blend of influences fuels her creative
evolution and shapes her vision for the future.
Paula Tape is a dedicated artist who continually learns and evolves her craft, driven by a
lifelong love for music and a relentless pursuit of her artistic identity. Her music reflects a
conscious aversion to definitions, allowing her the freedom to experiment and create
promising exciting experiences for her audience.

Based in Berlin, Germany, she is celebrated for her vibrant, eclectic sound that seamlessly blends house, techno, disco, and touches of her Korean heritage. With a career that spans over a decade, Peggy Gou has risen from an underground sensation to a mainstream icon, captivating audiences worldwide with her infectious beats, dynamic DJ sets, and a unique artistic vision that transcends music into fashion and culture.

### Early Life and Background
Peggy Gou was raised in a relatively conservative household in Incheon, South Korea. Her father, Kim Chang-yong, is a former journalist who later became a professor of mass communication at Inje University and a standing commissioner of the Korea Communications Commission. Music entered her life early, as she began classical piano lessons at the age of eight, laying the foundation for her musical sensibility. At 14, her parents sent her to London, England, to study English, a move that would prove pivotal in shaping her future. This exposure to a new culture sparked her curiosity and independence, setting her on a path far removed from the conventional expectations her family might have had for her.

In London, Gou initially pursued a career in fashion, enrolling at the London College of Fashion. During this time, she immersed herself in the city’s vibrant nightlife, discovering electronic music and the club scene. She frequented iconic venues like Plastic People, where she was exposed to house, techno, and other genres that would later influence her work. A friend in South Korea had taught her the basics of beatmatching years earlier, but it was in London that her passion for DJing truly ignited. After graduating, she briefly worked as a correspondent editor for *Harper’s Bazaar Korea* in London, but her growing love for music soon took precedence.

### Musical Beginnings and Move to Berlin
Peggy Gou’s professional music career began to take shape in the early 2010s. She returned to South Korea briefly at 18 but moved back to London six months later to chase her dreams. By 2013, she had taught herself to use Ableton Live, a digital audio workstation, and started producing her own tracks. Her early foray into DJing came in 2009, but it wasn’t until she relocated to Berlin—a global hub for electronic music—that her career gained momentum. Berlin’s underground scene, with its legendary clubs like Berghain and Panorama Bar, provided the perfect environment for her to hone her craft.

In 2016, Gou burst onto the scene with a prolific output, releasing four EPs across three labels: Rekids, Phonica White, and Technicolour. Her debut EP, *The Art of War*, showcased her signature style—bright, slightly hazy house tracks with intricate rhythms and a nod to her diverse influences, ranging from J Dilla to Yellow Magic Orchestra. Tracks like “Gou Talk” and “Seek for Maktoop” (the latter inspired by the Arabic word for “destiny”) highlighted her ability to fuse playful curiosity with technical skill. That year, she also began performing at high-profile gigs alongside artists like Moodymann and The Blessed Madonna, cementing her reputation as a rising star.

### Breakthrough and Rise to Fame
Peggy Gou’s breakthrough came in 2018 with the release of her *Once* EP on Ninja Tune. The lead single, “It Makes You Forget (Itgehane),” became an anthem, featuring her Korean-language vocals over a groovy deep house beat. The track’s infectious melody and cultural authenticity resonated widely, earning her the Best Track award at the AIM Independent Music Awards and a spot on the *FIFA 19* soundtrack. Its success marked a turning point, introducing her music to a broader audience and showcasing her ability to bridge underground and mainstream appeal.

In 2019, Gou’s star continued to rise. She launched her own independent record label, Gudu Records (meaning “shoes” in Korean), with a mission to support emerging artists and provide them with the opportunities she felt lacking early in her career. That same year, she released *Moment*, a two-track EP on Gudu, and *DJ-Kicks: Peggy Gou*, the 69th installment of !K7’s prestigious mix series. The compilation peaked at number nine on Billboard’s Dance/Electronic Album Sales chart, a testament to her growing influence. Forbes also recognized her as one of Asia’s leaders, pioneers, and entrepreneurs under 30, acknowledging her impact beyond music.

### Mainstream Success and Debut Album
Gou’s trajectory reached new heights in 2023 with the release of “(It Goes Like) Nanana” via XL Recordings. Sampling André Tanneberger’s 1998 trance hit “9 PM (Till I Come),” the track’s euphoric, Euro-dance-inspired sound became a global phenomenon, topping charts and amassing hundreds of millions of streams. Its viral success solidified her crossover appeal, blending her underground roots with pop sensibility. Later that year, she collaborated with Lenny Kravitz on “I Believe in Love Again,” further showcasing her versatility.

On June 7, 2024, Peggy Gou released her long-awaited debut album, *I Hear You*, through XL Recordings. The album, a culmination of years of refinement, features a mix of dancefloor anthems and introspective tracks, including “Nanana” and “I Go,” a tribute to the sounds of her youth. Gou described the transition from EPs to a full-length album as a “step to a musician,” reflecting her evolution as an artist. Critics praised its timeless quality, with Gou emphasizing her desire to create music that endures beyond fleeting trends.

### Musical Style and Influences
Peggy Gou’s sound is a kaleidoscope of influences, drawing from deep house, tech house, trance, nu-disco, and traditional Korean music. Her tracks often feature groovy basslines, catchy hooks, and MPC-led rhythms, evoking the warmth and joy of house and techno’s golden eras. She has cited artists like J Dilla, Patrick Cowley, DJ Nature, and Peven Everett as inspirations, alongside her experiences in London and Berlin. Gou sometimes refers to her music as “K-house,” a nod to her Korean roots, which she proudly incorporates through vocals and cultural motifs.

Her DJ sets are equally eclectic, weaving together dark, pulsing techno, broken beats, and abstract compositions. Known for her kinetic energy behind the decks, she effortlessly shifts between genres, creating immersive experiences that resonate with both purists and casual listeners.

### Beyond Music: Fashion and Cultural Impact
In addition to her musical achievements, Peggy Gou is a multifaceted creative. In 2019, she launched her fashion label, KIRIN (meaning “giraffe” in Korean), under the New Guards Group with support from the late Virgil Abloh. The brand reflects her bold, playful aesthetic, blending streetwear with high fashion. Her personal style—often featuring vibrant colors and retro influences—has made her a fashion icon, further amplifying her cultural influence.

Gou’s rise has also spotlighted diversity in electronic music. As a Korean artist in a predominantly Western genre, she has broken barriers, becoming the first Korean nominated in the international song category at the 2024 Brit Awards. She advocates for gender equality in the industry, speaking candidly about sexism and the need for greater representation of women.

### Personal Life and Legacy
Now 33 years old as of April 8, 2025, Peggy Gou remains based in Berlin, though her career keeps her jetting across the globe. With nearly 4 million Instagram followers, she connects with fans through humor and authenticity, balancing her larger-than-life persona with a down-to-earth charm. Her relentless ambition drives her forward—she has said she’s “not done yet,” hinting at even grander plans ahead.

Peggy Gou’s journey—from a piano-playing child in Incheon to a global dance music titan—is a testament to her talent, perseverance, and vision.

This time, his performance will feature an organic, evolving structure, merging visual and sonic elements in a dynamic, immersive fusion of sight and sound.', 'https://irjubpjnvgdhlyzigdpn.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/MySonar%20Videos//Plastikman.mp4', 'CA', '00:00:00', '01:00:00', 'Plastikman is the most renowned alias of Richie Hawtin, a British-Canadian electronic music artist, DJ, and techno pioneer whose innovative contributions have left an indelible mark on the global electronic music landscape. Born Richard Hawtin on June 4, 1970, in Banbury, Oxfordshire, England, he moved with his family to LaSalle, Ontario, Canada, at the age of nine. Growing up across the river from Detroit, the birthplace of techno, Hawtin was immersed in a fertile musical environment that shaped his career. His father, a robotics technician at General Motors and an enthusiast of electronic music, introduced him to the sounds of Kraftwerk and Tangerine Dream, sparking an early fascination with synthesizers and technology that would define his artistic journey.

Hawtin’s foray into music began in his teens, DJing at Detroit clubs by the age of 17. His early sets blended house and techno, reflecting the vibrant underground scene of the late 1980s. In 1990, he co-founded Plus 8 Records with John Acquaviva, a label named after the pitch-adjust function on their turntables, signaling their intent to push boundaries. It was under this banner that Hawtin debuted his Plastikman persona in 1992, a project that would become synonymous with minimal techno and acid-infused experimentation. Plastikman emerged as a distinct entity, characterized by its lean, hypnotic beats and sparse, acid-tinged synth lines—sounds that distilled techno to its raw essence while retaining an otherworldly allure.

The first Plastikman album, *Sheet One* (1993), released on NovaMute, was a groundbreaking statement. Tracks like "Plasticity" and "Helikopter" fused pulsating rhythms with ambient and psychedelic undertones, earning critical acclaim and a cult following. The album’s packaging, designed to resemble a sheet of blotter acid, underscored its subversive edge. This release cemented Plastikman’s reputation as a force in the second wave of Detroit techno, alongside peers like Jeff Mills and Robert Hood, while Hawtin’s Windsor base kept him tied to the region’s underground ethos. The 1993 single "Spastik," with its relentless, percussive energy, became an anthem, showcasing Plastikman’s ability to craft dancefloor weapons that doubled as sonic experiments.

In 1994, Hawtin followed up with *Musik*, a sophomore album that refined his vision. Tracks like "Plastique" and "Marbles" leaned into psychedelic and industrial influences, pushing techno into uncharted territory. This period also saw Hawtin’s live performances evolve, incorporating turntables, effects processors, and instruments like the Roland TR-909 drum machine and SH-101 synthesizer. His innovative setups expanded the possibilities of DJing, blending pre-recorded elements with live manipulation to create immersive, dynamic experiences. These shows, often staged in dark, strobe-lit venues around Detroit and Windsor, became legendary, drawing ravers and techno purists alike.

Hawtin’s output as Plastikman continued to diversify. In 1996, he embarked on the *Concept 1* project, a year-long series of 12 minimalist singles that explored rhythm and texture with surgical precision. This experiment foreshadowed the stark, introspective turn of *Consumed* (1998), widely regarded as a masterpiece. Stripping techno to its bones, *Consumed* featured slow, shadowy tracks like "Contain" and "Consume," drenched in reverb and eerie synths. Its pitch-black atmosphere marked a shift from the genre’s hedonistic roots to a more transcendent, almost oppressive soundscape, appealing to both club-goers and headphone listeners. That same year, Hawtin launched M_nus Records, a platform for his minimalist ethos and a home for like-minded artists.

After a period of exploration under other aliases like F.U.S.E. and a move to New York in the early 2000s, Hawtin revived Plastikman with *Closer* (2003). Recorded back in Windsor, the album delved deeper into his psyche, blending stark beats with haunting vocals—a rare addition to the Plastikman catalog. By this time, Hawtin had relocated to Berlin, a hub for electronic music, where his reputation as a DJ and innovator soared. His live sets, now incorporating cutting-edge technology like Ableton Live (which he beta-tested) and custom controllers, redefined performance norms. Events like Hard, Harder, Hardest and Heaven & Hell, rooted in the raw energy of Detroit’s Music Institute, solidified Plastikman’s status as an underground hero.

The Plastikman project lay dormant for much of the 2000s as Hawtin focused on DJing and ventures like his ENTER. residency in Ibiza. However, a 2013 performance at New York’s Guggenheim Museum, commissioned by fashion designer Raf Simons, reignited his creative spark. The resulting album, *EX* (2014), captured the live energy of that event, featuring tracks composed around an LED obelisk installation. It marked a triumphant return, blending Plastikman’s signature minimalism with a renewed experimental edge. In 2022, Hawtin collaborated with pianist Chilly Gonzales on *Consumed in Key*, a reimagining of the 1998 album that layered classical textures over its techno framework, showcasing Plastikman’s enduring versatility.

Beyond music, Hawtin’s influence extends to technology and culture. His company Liine developed tools like the Synk app, enhancing audience interaction during Plastikman’s 2010-2011 live tour. His work has earned praise from figures like Daniel Miller of Mute Records, who called him a pioneer, and Raf Simons, who likened him to Kraftwerk. Plastikman remains Hawtin’s most iconic creation—a vehicle for exploring the intersections of sound, technology, and human experience, from the gritty warehouses of Detroit to the art galleries of New York.

Comprising Paul Armand-Delille (known as Polocorp or Polo) and Alexandre Grynszpan (known as Peter Pan or Pan), the duo has carved a unique niche in the global music scene with their sophisticated yet playful approach to electronic music. Their work evokes a sense of nostalgia, wanderlust, and hedonistic joy, often likened to a musical journey through exotic locales and bygone eras, drawing comparisons to Golden Era Hollywood films or sun-drenched dance floors from Saint-Tropez to Rio de Janeiro.

### Early Beginnings and Formation
The story of Polo & Pan begins in Paris, where both Paul and Alexandre were already established figures in the city’s vibrant nightlife before their paths crossed. Paul Armand-Delille, a multifaceted artist with a background in sound design and composition, had been active in the music scene, performing at prestigious venues like Bagatelle, Social Club, and Régine’s, and even contributing as a sound design manager for brands like Louis Vuitton. His early work included mystical, desert-inspired electronic tracks, such as those found in his *Roudani 434* EP, and he was involved with the group Open Space & Stars, releasing the album *Pop Prophecy* in 2010, though it saw limited commercial success. Meanwhile, Alexandre Grynszpan was a seasoned DJ and musical historian with an insatiable passion for crate-digging, collecting rare vinyl records spanning the early 20th century to contemporary electronics, including obscure gems like Nepalese psychedelic rock from the 1970s. Grynszpan was also a co-founder of the innovative *Radiooooo* project, an online encyclopedic radio launched in 2013 that celebrates global music across time.

Their fateful meeting occurred in 2012 at Le Baron, a legendary Parisian nightclub known for its eclectic atmosphere and celebrity clientele. Both Paul and Alexandre were resident DJs at the venue, where the open-format, selector-driven ethos encouraged them to experiment with improbable mixes—blending oldies, hip-hop, and electronic beats. This shared love for genre fusion and cultural exploration sparked an instant connection. Initially, they collaborated by remixing existing tracks, honing their chemistry behind the decks. By 2013, they officially formed Polo & Pan, retreating to a studio in Asnières built by Paul to begin crafting original music.

### Musical Style and Evolution
Polo & Pan’s sound is difficult to pin down, a testament to their versatility and refusal to conform to electronic music trends. At its core, their music blends house and disco with tropical and world music elements, often layered with live instrumentation, lush arrangements, and a cinematic flair. Influences range from South American rhythms to French pop, classical music, and even vintage Disney soundtracks, reflecting their penchant for mining the past to create something fresh and timeless. Tracks like “Canopée” and “Dorothy” showcase their ability to craft infectious, danceable melodies with a surreal, otherworldly quality, while their live performances—complete with linen suits, pan flutes, and theatrical flourishes—bring an immersive, joyous energy to the stage.

Their debut EP, *Rivolta* (2013), released under Hamburger Records, set the tone for their career. The title track fused a 1930s Italian standard with a Moroder-esque disco bassline, signaling their intent to bridge eras and cultures. This was followed by *Dorothy* (2014), inspired by *The Wizard of Oz*, and *Plage Isolée* (2015), meaning “isolated beach,” both of which leaned into surreal, tropical vibes. These early releases established Polo & Pan as innovators within the electronic scene, blending multicultural and multi-genre elements into a cohesive, dreamy soundscape.

### Breakthrough with *Caravelle*
After a brief hiatus to refine their identity, Polo & Pan returned in 2017 with their debut album, *Caravelle*, released on May 19 under Hamburger Records and Caroline. The 12-track, 52-minute album was a critical and commercial triumph, earning gold certification from the SNEP (Syndicat National de l'Édition Phonographique) in 2019. Featuring collaborations with artists like Marguerite Bartherotte, Victoria Lafaurie, and Alain Chamfort, *Caravelle* explored themes of travel, dreams, and joy, eschewing melancholy for an uplifting, escapist narrative. Standout tracks like “Nanã” (also gold-certified) and “Cœur Croisé” (accompanied by a music video) showcased their knack for crafting lush, melodic house with a global twist. Critics, including Julien Baldacchino of France Inter and Les Inrocks, hailed it as the “soundtrack of summer 2017.” A deluxe edition with five additional tracks followed in July 2018, alongside the *Mexicali* EP and a world tour from September to December that year.

### Global Success with *Cyclorama*
Polo & Pan’s sophomore album, *Cyclorama* (June 2021), marked their evolution into a fully realized creative force. The album, a conceptual journey through the human lifecycle—birth, childhood, adulthood, death, and transcendence—refined their cinematic approach, blending house, disco, techno, and psychedelia. Its lead single, “Ani Kuni,” based on a Native American Arapaho hymn popularized in France in the 1970s, became their biggest hit, peaking at number 10 on the French SNEP Singles Chart and charting in Belgium. Written by Alexandre for his son, the track’s nostalgic resonance and festive energy captivated audiences worldwide. Other highlights included the upbeat “Feel Good” (from a 2020 EP of the same name) and the introspective “Melody,” showcasing richer textures and emotional depth. Collaborations with figures like Vladimir Cosma on “Bilboquet” hinted at future cinematic ambitions, while the closing track, “Peter Pan,” affirmed their enduring playful spirit.

### Recent Work and Legacy
In 2025, Polo & Pan returned with *22:22*, a nocturnal, dance-driven odyssey featuring high-profile collaborations with Metronomy, Beth Ditto, and Arthur Teboul, accompanied by a global tour. This release, announced in posts on X in April 2025, underscores their continued relevance and ability to evolve while staying true to their signature sound. With a discography that includes two studio albums, numerous EPs, and a reputation for sold-out tours and festival appearances, Polo & Pan have become synonymous with a sophisticated yet carefree brand of electronic music.

Paul and Alexandre’s complementary dynamic—Paul as the technical, creative visionary and Alexandre as the gregarious, crowd-pleasing DJ—has fueled their success. Their meticulous, perfectionist approach, rejection of fleeting trends, and commitment to live instrumentation set them apart in an era of fast-fashion electronic music.

ROOM WITH A VIEW
about the creation
In just a few albums, Rone has secured his place as one of the most influential French producers
around, putting some of his own soul into electro. He is now adding another dimension to his career
with the creation of the show Room with a View and his eponymous fifth album. Having been invited by
the Théâtre du Châtelet for a carte blanche, he was keen to work with (LA)HORDE and consequently
with the dancers of the Ballet National de Marseille.
In a marble quarry, various machines are in action, cutting and polishing the rock. In this otherworldly
place and behind his machines, Rone sculpts sweeping electronic and emotional landscapes that he
offers to a group of dancers.
While sculptors worked with marble to “free the human form inside the block” (Michelangelo), the
performers dance to escape the stones’ white immobility, rising up to scrutinise the infinitely human
contours of impending disaster and envisaging the very possibility of its beauty.
(LA)HORDE continues to explore forms of protest and rebellion through dance. Room with a View is
a blank page, a space devised as a naturalist white cube in which sounds, bodies and images can be
inscribed to reflect on the shifting place of humanity. For Rone it provided the opportunity required
for a new album, a unique performance in which the cries of his machines resonate, inviting us to
break away and trace vanishing lines towards songs that exist far beyond mankind itself.
Very early on we identified shared ground that reflects with what’s going on in society: patriarchal
culture, geo-social battles, the environment, things falling apart. Talking about violence in the world,
sharing it and bringing it back to life, but making room for light, for joy, which alone makes us
capable of participating in collective transformation. And fully inhabiting it with our bodies.
Room With A View talks about the power of the collective, both unique and comprised of individuals.
It’s there, the light of hope. Nothing happens on its own, it all happens with many people. That’s the
beauty of the group.

ALAIN DAMASIO
Author Alain Damasio mixes in his work science fiction, fantasy and poli-
tical dystopia. The same yeay they created the collective (LA)HORDE, Ma-
rine Brutti, Jonathan Debrouwer and Arthur Harel discovered his « world
book», La Horde du Contrevent. RONE has been collaborating for years
with the author. Bora Vocal , their first track together, mixes melancholic
sounds with extracts from an audio diary he kept during the writing of
La Horde du Contrevent. Alain Damasio also participated to Rone’s Live
at the Philharmonie de Paris in 2017. At the invitation of RONE and (LA)
HORDE, Alain Damasio attended several rehearsals of Room With A View
at CCN Ballet national de Marseille. He gives us his opinion on the piece.
brutale dans l’époque. Un piqué bec en avant sur le lac glacé du capitalisme
tardif. Nous voilà à la fois au volant et à la place du mort de la voiture-bal-
let d’un monde qui se délite : le moteur surchauffe, l’essence va bientôt
manquer et la durite s’apprête à péter. On y a pourtant encore assez « de
chaos en soi pour mettre au monde une étoile qui danse », sortir de la ba-
gnole et respirer cet air d’été en plein hiver, hormis que chaque pas, chaque
saut qu’on fait sur ce lac en débâcle en fissure un peu plus la surface...

la solitude crie en silence, tout s’effondre. La nuit remue. Et la boîte n’est
même plus assez solide pour contenir ces rages qui la travaillent.
Ça finit là où, pour nous tous, ça devrait commencer. Avec les mêmes corps
têtus, cette fois-ci out-of-the-box, comme échappés de la carrière aux-
quels on les destinait. Ils dansent à nouveau ensemble, en symbiose et syn-
chrones. Comme un seul homme ? précisément pas : comme la multitude
qu’ils et elles sont et restent, sauf qu’elle a trouvé, désormais, la matière
partagée d’une résonance. Et la splendeur d’un ajustement rythmique qui
pour elle et pour nous fait sens.
Et vous regardez ça, angoissés, de votre chambre, impuissants, de votre
tour, de votre bus, de votre bureau ? Tous égo dans la même merde ? Room
With A View vous sort de la boîte. Elle chorégraphie en 90 minutes cette
évidence : que la crise du vivant est d’abord une crise de la sensibilité. Une
crise des corps dévitalisés, coupés d’eux-mêmes, coupés des autres, coupés
du sol et des sèves. Ce sont ces corps qu’elle nous ramène, à fleur de paume,
presque à toucher, à vouloir les enlacer, les saisir, dans un spectacle qui est
moins optique et sonore, qu’haptique et sonar. RONE y officie d’ailleurs en

qui faisait encore lien : l’éducation, l’action sociale, la santé, le chômage, les
retraites. Oh les vilains mots dans un livret...

Their back-to-back performance at Sónar by Night promises a magical, seamless display of their unique musical chemistry.', 'https://irjubpjnvgdhlyzigdpn.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/MySonar%20Videos//Saoirse_b2b_Ryan_Elliott.mp4', 'IE/US', '21:00:00', '23:00:00', 'As an established and authoritative figure in dance music, Saoirse has crafted a career that
traverses sonic worlds, subcultures and scenes. With each milestone, the Irish-born DJ,
producer, trUst label boss and Body Movements festival founder flexes her creative muscle
further –
through it all, remaining passionate about music discovery, building inclusive
community, and adding new dimensions to her artistry.
Saoirse’s allegiance to the electronic was forged in her home country of Ireland, where from
beginnings in inner-city Dublin housing and trailing after her mother to free parties, she
cultivated her obsession with the sounds of Leftfield, Prodigy and Orbital. The Irish artist cut
her path with an enduringly DIY, by-the-bootstraps spirit – defying genre snobbery, scene
misogyny, and small town mentalities as she went. As a teenager, her days were spent on
local pirate radio and hustling for sets in Ireland’s hard house and trance spaces. Slowly, she
made money from any jobs she could find, eventually working in Abbey Discs, one of
Ireland’s most renowned dance music record stores, and doing seasonal work in Ibiza. From
this she began building a globe-trotting vinyl collection that formed an alternative education,
and her tastes expanded into new realms of house and techno.
An epiphanic moment on the dancefloor of fabric during a Villalobos set inspired her to
relocate and pursue things seriously. She secured a job at Resident Advisor age 23, where
the music industry landscape unfurled. Quickly, Saoirse moved from hometown support slots
to playing London’s most hallowed venues and nights –
Phonox, fabric, FOLD, Adonis,
Chapter 10 – and frequenting countries across Europe, the US and Asia, from Berlin to Bali
and the Balearics, and festivals like Sonar, Horst, Love International and Strawberry Fields.
“I like to take risks,
” she says,
“and respond to the crowd –
I want to move really fluidly from
what’s wacky, ravey, headsy. Maybe an all-nighter will start on tech house and finish in the
depths of liquid bass, or jungle and jazz.
” A Saoirse DJ set is revenant in research yet
unbridled by rules. Using her cavernous bag of records, she oscillates from sweaty dark
room chuggers to bubbling bass and garage, euphoric and elastic house to tunes made for
soundtracking sunset festival sets. She is a longterm resident of Barcelona’s famed queer
party Maricas, and maintains her own party, trUst, where she has brought in and played
alongside artists including Spekki Webbu, Nicolas Lutz and Eris Drew. Earlier in 2023, she
curated a night at fabric with frequent collaborator Shanti Celeste.
Radio, too, has been a defining space to experiment and grow: at RINSE, she was the first
house-focused resident show and became known for championing respected legends and
emerging guests from DJ DEEON to Aurora Halal. Her rallying Resident Advisor mix, Radio
1 Residency and Essential Mix carved out more ambitious, frenetic soundscapes that would
become elemental references for the wider scene.
Her label trUst Recordings highlights Saoirse’s core ethos –
emphasising trust with her
creative collaborators, and tracks that get people heads down.
“A club tool comes naturally
to me when producing,
” Saorse says. Two EPs, trUst 001 and Two Bruised Egos, are the
natural progression from DJ to producer, articulating the frissons of the rave with rich
textures and experimental vocal samples. Saoirse now steps up with a fabric presents
compilation – a pivotal, incredibly personal achievement. It elevates the experience of her
amorphous DJ sets, exploring all corners of the electronic realm that she knows and loves.
“I
want it to feel timeless, so I leaned into the textures I know from within those club walls,
”
Saoirse says.
“This is where music truly influenced my life, where I learned to be a good
raver and where the longevity of the dancefloor hit home.

OF YEARS HAVE SEEN SICARIA FIRMLY ESTABLISH HERSELF AS A SOLO ARTIST.
KNOWN FOR CREATING A SENSE OF COMMUNITY AROUND THE MUSIC SHE PLAYS,
SICARIA VALUES A GRASSROOTS APPROACH TO ELECTRONIC MUSIC,
CHAMPIONING THE CULTURE FROM THE GROUND UP. THIS ETHOS HAS EARNED
HER RECOGNITION NOT JUST AS A LEADING DJ BUT ALSO AS A HUGE ROLE
MODEL TO HER LOYAL FANBASE AND OTHER ARTISTS IN THE DANCE MUSIC
SCENE.
CHARACTERISED BY HER BOISTEROUS PERSONALITY AND FUELED BY HER PASSION
FOR THE GENRE, SICARIA CONTINUES TO BE STRONGLY PRAISED WITHIN THE
DANCE-MUSIC COMMUNITY FOR SUPPORTING EVERYTHING WHICH IS EXCITING AND
FORWARD-THINKING IN BASS MUSIC, CEMENTING HER STATUS AS A HEAVYWEIGHT
ADVOCATE FOR LIVELY, CHEST-RATTLING 140 BPM SOUNDS.
TAKING HER FIERY LIVE SETS TO DECKS ALL OVER THE WORLD, FROM MIAMI TO
TBILISI, SICARIA HAS SUPPORTED NOTABLE ARTISTS SUCH AS SKRILLEX, CHASE &
STATUS, AND BICEP. WITH FANS AMONG TASTEMAKERS LIKE CRACK, RA, MIXMAG,
AND BOILER ROOM, SICARIA’S INFLUENCE CONTINUES TO GROW. SHE WAS ALSO
HANDPICKED AS ONE OF JUST 12 ARTISTS FOR BEATPORT NEXT: CLASS OF 2025, A
PRESTIGIOUS ARTIST DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM THAT CHAMPIONS EMERGING
TALENTS WITH EXCEPTIONAL PROMISE. WITH A PACKED GLOBAL TOURING
SCHEDULE STILL AHEAD THIS YEAR, SICARIA IS POISED TO BLOW.

THE PAST
BORN AND BASED IN LONDON BUT OF MOROCCAN DESCENT, SICARIA CITES HER
CONNECTION TO SWANA CULTURE AS THE MAIN INFLUENCE SHAPING HER IDENTITY
GROWING UP - PROVIDING A CONTINUOUS EXPOSURE TO MUSIC RANGING FROM
CLASSICAL ARABIC TO EGYPTIAN SHAABI, ALGERIAN RAÏ TO MOROCCAN GNAWA
AND EVERYTHING IN BETWEEN.
A SHY CHILD, HER EARLY AFFECTION FOR MUSIC WOULD SEE HER SIGN UP TO
LOCAL DANCE AND MUSICAL THEATER GROUPS, WHICH FORMED THE BASIS OF HER
EMPOWERING ON-STAGE PERSONA TODAY. IT WASN’T UNTIL HER TEENAGE
EXPLORATIONS INTO ELECTRONIC DANCE MUSIC THAT SHE LAID THE FOUNDATION
OF HER CURRENT LOVE FOR BASS-DRIVEN SOUNDS. INSPIRED TO ESCAPE HER
UNIVERSITY STUDIES, SICARIA INVESTED IN HER FIRST PAIR OF CDJS, SETTING THE
WHEELS IN MOTION FOR HER CAREER.
SHE FELL INTO RADIO PRODUCTION AFTER GRADUATING AND SOON STARTED CO-
PILOTING A REGULAR SHOW GEARED TOWARDS CREATING A SPACE FOR WOMEN
ON RADIO WITHIN THE DUBSTEP COMMUNITY. LITTLE DID SHE KNOW THAT THIS
FIRST FORAY INTO PRESENTING WOULD BE A DEFINITIVE MOVE INTO BECOMING A
TASTEMAKER OF INNOVATIVE LOW-END HEAVY SOUNDS. LATER, HER PRIME-TIME
MONTHLY RESIDENCY ON RINSE FM WOULD GAIN A GLOBAL CULT FOLLOWING.
HAVING NAVIGATED AS ONE HALF OF THE IMPRINT SICARIA SOUND FOR SIX YEARS,
SHE AND HER PARTNER WERE NOTED AS THE UNDISPUTED CHAMPIONS OF
DANCEFLOORS WORLDWIDE, EXPOSING DUBSTEP AS A CULTURE TO AN ENTIRELY
NEW AUDIENCE. NOW, AS AN INDIVIDUAL ARTIST, SICARIA SEEKS TO CARRY FORTH
THIS LEGACY INTO NEW VENTURES.
WITH IMPRESSIVE APPEARANCES ON BOILER ROOM, BBC RADIO 1 & 1XTRA, AND
NTS, AS WELL AS BEING NOMINATED FOR THE ‘BEST DJ’ CATEGORY IN DJ MAG’S
2023 BEST OF BRITISH AWARDS, SICARIA HAS RIGHTFULLY CLAIMED HER TITLE AS A
CLUB MAINSTAY. THESE LIVELY DJ SETS HAVE SEEN HER BOOKED FOR REVERED
CLUBS, FESTIVALS, AND ARENAS ACROSS THE GLOBE, WHILST ALSO COLLECTING
ACCOLADES FROM PROFESSIONAL CREATIVE BODIES SUCH AS HELP MUSICIANS.

(2025)
THE FUTURE
2024 MARKED A DEFINING MOMENT FOR SICARIA AS SHE BROUGHT HER VISIONARY
'BACK 2 BASICS' TOUR TO LIFE, COLLABORATING WITH LOCAL 140 PLATFORMS AND
SOUNDSYSTEMS TO CHAMPION EMERGING TALENT AND REKINDLE THE
GRASSROOTS ENERGY OF THE SCENE. THIS MILESTONE WAS JUST THE BEGINNING.
IN 2025, SICARIA WILL EMBARK ON HER MOST AMBITIOUS PROJECT YET: A FULL-
LENGTH MIXTAPE-STYLE RELEASE THAT FUSES HER LOVE FOR LOW-END SOUNDS
WITH POWERFUL COLLABORATIONS FEATURING MCS AND VOCALISTS. CARRYING A
BOLD MESSAGE ABOUT STAYING TRUE TO YOURSELF, THIS PROJECT WILL BE A
SONIC MANIFESTO FOR INDIVIDUALITY AND AUTHENTICITY.
BUT THE MUSIC IS JUST ONE PART OF THE STORY. WITH IMMERSIVE EVENTS AND
ACTIVATIONS PLANNED TO BRING THE MIXTAPE TO LIFE, SICARIA WILL DEEPEN HER
CONNECTION WITH HER AUDIENCE, CREATING MOMENTS THAT EXTEND BEYOND
THE DANCEFLOOR. ALONGSIDE THIS, SHE WILL STEP INTO THE WORLD OF
PRESENTED CONTENT AND BRAND COLLABORATIONS, SPOTLIGHTING HER
CHARISMATIC PERSONALITY AND UNIQUE PERSPECTIVE IN NEW AND EXCITING
WAYS.
THIS NEXT CHAPTER IS SET TO BE A THRILLING EVOLUTION OF SICARIA’S ARTISTRY
—ONE THAT BLURS THE BOUNDARIES BETWEEN SOUND, STORYTELLING, AND SELF-
EXPRESSION. AND WITH EVEN MORE IN THE WORKS, ONE THING REMAINS CERTAIN:

### Skee Mask (Bryan Müller)

#### Biography
Bryan Müller, known professionally as Skee Mask, is a German electronic music producer and DJ hailing from Munich. Born in 1993, Müller emerged onto the scene in the mid-2010s, quickly establishing himself as a key figure in contemporary electronic music. His early career was shaped by his deep appreciation for the sounds of the 1990s, including hardcore, jungle, ambient techno, and breakbeat-driven club music. This reverence for the past, combined with a forward-thinking production style, has made him a standout artist in the modern techno and IDM scenes.

Müller released his debut EP, *Serum*, in 2014 under the Skee Mask alias on the Munich-based label Ilian Tape, run by the Zenker Brothers. This marked the beginning of a fruitful relationship with the label, which would become a cornerstone of his career. His first full-length album, *Shred* (2016), showcased his ability to craft intricate, high-energy tracks that balanced raw breakbeats with atmospheric textures. The album received critical acclaim and set the stage for his subsequent releases.

In 2018, Skee Mask dropped his sophomore LP, *Compro*, which Pitchfork hailed as "Best New Music." The album demonstrated his evolution as an artist, weaving together melancholic melodies, crisp percussion, and immersive soundscapes. Tracks like "Dial 274" and "Session Add" became anthems for fans of underground electronic music. Following *Compro*, Müller continued to push boundaries with the expansive triple album *Pool* (2021), a sprawling 18-track project that explored everything from ambient techno to euphoric breakbeat excursions. His meticulous production style—often described as both surgical and soulful—earned him a devoted following.

Beyond his studio work, Skee Mask is a highly sought-after DJ, known for eclectic sets that traverse techno, jungle, IDM, and beyond. He was a resident DJ at Munich’s Blitz Club from 2017 to 2022, where he honed his skills and built a reputation for unpredictable, genre-crossing performances. Müller’s principled stance on the music industry—he has been vocal about avoiding mainstream hype and maintaining artistic integrity—further solidifies his status as a revered figure in the underground.

#### Musical Style
Skee Mask’s sound is a fusion of nostalgia and innovation. Drawing inspiration from the ‘90s dance music canon—think Aphex Twin, early Warp Records, and the raw energy of jungle—he infuses these influences with modern production techniques. His tracks often feature dusty breakbeats, euphoric synths, and ambient interludes, creating a sense of both movement and introspection. Whether crafting high-octane club bangers or reflective downtempo pieces, Müller’s work is characterized by its emotional depth and technical precision.

### Actress (Darren J. Cunningham)

#### Biography
Darren J. Cunningham, better known as Actress, is a British electronic musician and producer whose career spans over two decades. Born in Wolverhampton, England, Cunningham launched his musical journey in 2004 with the release of *No Tricks*, an eccentric single on his own Werk Discs label. Since then, he has become one of the UK’s most distinctive and enigmatic electronic artists, known for his abstract, genre-blurring approach to music.

Actress gained widespread recognition with his 2010 album *Splazsh*, a woozy, experimental take on techno and bass music that earned critical acclaim and a spot on numerous year-end lists. The album’s innovative sound—merging Detroit techno influences with British IDM and noisy dub—established Cunningham as a visionary in the field. He followed it up with *R.I.P.* (2012), a darker, more conceptual work that delved into themes of decay and transformation, further cementing his reputation for pushing boundaries.

Over the years, Actress has released a string of acclaimed albums, including *Ghettoville* (2014), *AZD* (2017), and *Lageos* (2018, a collaboration with the London Contemporary Orchestra). His most recent full-length, *Statik* (2024), released on Norway’s Smalltown Supersound, is a meditative, ethereal exploration of liquified beats and buoyant synths, drawing comparisons to the aquatic techno of Drexciya. Each project showcases Cunningham’s ability to evolve while retaining a signature sound that feels both futuristic and timeless.

As a performer, Actress is known for his cerebral, often unpredictable live sets and DJ performances. His work extends beyond music into art and technology, reflecting his interest in artificial intelligence and abstract sound design. Cunningham’s elusive persona—he rarely grants interviews or engages with mainstream media—adds to his mystique, making him a cult figure in electronic music circles.

#### Musical Style
Actress’s music defies easy categorization, blending elements of techno, electro, ambient, and R&B into a hazy, otherworldly whole. His productions often feature distorted rhythms, glitchy textures, and submerged melodies, creating a sense of disorientation and beauty. Influences from Detroit techno pioneers like Derrick May and the experimental ethos of artists like Autechre are evident, but Cunningham filters them through a distinctly British lens, incorporating the gritty pulse of UK bass music and dub. His work is both intellectual and visceral, inviting listeners into a sonic universe that feels simultaneously alien and familiar.

These performances—often featured at cutting-edge festivals like Sónar, Unsound, or Boiler Room events—bring together Müller’s precise, breakbeat-driven energy and Cunningham’s abstract, atmospheric soundscapes.

Sonny Moore aka Skrillex is a record producer, DJ, musician, singer and songwriter
hailing from Los Angeles who has won 8 Grammy Awards, been named MTV’s Electronic
Dance Music Artist of the Year, and holds the record for most Grammys won by an electronic
artist. He’s headlined arenas and festivals globally and graced the covers of magazine
heavyweights like Rolling Stone and Wired. His recent travels have led to him collaborating with
some of the most forward-thinking and avante garde voices in music such as Fred again.., Four
T et, Bladee, Yung Lean, Missy Elliot, Kid Cudi, Chief Keef, & countless others.
In February of 2023, Skrillex, Fred again.., & Four T et decided to do a week long New York City
takeover leading up to the release of Skrillex’s highly anticipated sophomore album Quest For
Fire. The trio played a series of surprise pop up raves across the city where tickets and location
weren’t announced until the day of show. Their first pop up took place on Valentine’s Day at
Good Room followed by a larger party two days later at Le Poisson Rouge where Skrillex would
release Quest For Fire while performing. The trio then played a massive live set in the middle of
Times Square for The Lot Radio broadcasted from a school bus turned sound system the
following day. Skrillex would wrap up this historical week by announcing an additional surprise
pop-up, this time taking place inside New York City's legendary Madison Square Garden with
tickets selling out within minutes of the announcement. The event played out as a 5-hour long
rave with Skrillex, Fred again.., and Four T et DJing from the moment doors opened until close.
Skrillex shocked fans by dropping an additional surprise album, Don’t Get Too Close, in the
middle of his performance and bootleg CD copies of the project were given out to attendees at
the end of the night. This monumental week of performances and releases was referred to as a
“masterclass of album rollout” by Billboard magazine and marked the beginning of a new era in
Skrillex’s prolific career.
Previous work with Jack Ü, his project with Diplo, had their eponymous album reach #1
on the US Dance charts with the track “Where Are Ü Now” ft Justin Bieber going 4x platinum.
Skrillex linked with Bieber again for the 8x platinum “Sorry”
, which debuted at #1 on the
Billboard Hot 100. His label, OWSLA, has launched the careers of some of the most powerful
names in electronic music including Marshmello, Zedd, Porter Robinson & Mija. He later worked
with friend/cult filmmaker Harmony Korine by scoring his critically acclaimed Spring Breakers
movie and composed an original track for Pixar’s Wreck It Ralph. He simultaneously penned
one of the biggest club hits of the year with A$AP Rocky (Wild For The Night) and dropped his
first fashion collaboration with G-Star (it sold out globally in a matter of days). Skrillex took some
much needed time off from a never ceasing touring schedule to enjoy some time split between
T okyo and Los Angeles for a creative sabbatical, where his focus was on finishing up a trove of
new music.
Following the COVID-19 pandemic, Skrillex started 2023 on a high note by releasing a
series of collaborative singles and selling out pop-up performances across the world while
sharing his travels with fans through social media. This captivating run quickly garnered the
attention and praise from both his fanbase and press alike. With recent releases such as
“Rumble” featuring Fred again.. & Flowdan along with “Xena” featuring Nai Barghouti all
receiving positive reception, Skrillex’s new music continues to highlight why the forward-thinking
producer remains on top of his genre. His work with Trippie Redd and PinkPantheress on “Way
Back” add to his legacy as a genre expanding musician who is never afraid to work outside of
his own lane. Skrillex also dropped his first music video of the year alongside DrainGang CEO
Bladee showing off his new look on their collaborative single “Real Spring.
” He released his
sophomore album Quest For Fire on February 17th of 2023 and followed up with an additional
surprise album, Don’t Get Too Close, on February 18th which he dropped during his sold out
performance at MSG alongside Fred again.. and Four T et. The trio’s collaborative track “Baby
again..
”
, which became a fan favorite after initially being previewed by Fred again.. during his
legendary Boiler Room debut, was officially released on March 17th of 2023 with an
accompanying hour long video that was filmed during their pop up rave at MSG. While there is

 Julio Sosa, also known as DJ SOSA RD (Dominican Republic, 1988), as a product of his time, can only be categorized at the intersection between installative and audiovisual art, music production, and DJ sets. He made his debut in music in 2006, in his native Santo Domingo, understanding from the outset that
 mixing and sampling were useful tools for recontextualization in a country that has gone through various
 narratives of resistance and colonization.
 In 2013, he moved to Spain to pursue a master's degree in Visual Arts and Multimedia, evolving the skills of his artistic practice. Always connecting his experiences in the subversive culture of the early raves with
 the political ethos of techno or the way of perceiving rhythms, partying, and dancing typical of Caribbean culture, which is a mix of indigenous heritage, African diasporas, and European influences. Sosa RD makes this great diversity of styles converse to form his own context, full of ferocity, irony, harmony, and new understandings, which propel us towards the global with unprecedented speed. In the current discographic landscape, his releases can be found on El Cuarto Elástico (Dominican Republic), TraTraTrax (Colombia), International Chrome (Germany), Promesses and Cuntry Club (France), or Noise Pollution Recording and Offline Meeting Point (Spain). He has released mixes on platforms such as Radio Raheem (Milan), Rinse (France), NTS (London), Dublab (Barcelona), and an audiovisual live set on Keep Hush Live Barcelona, curated by Alvva.

Carlotto Rose
T.MODET, nacida en Sevilla en 1985, ha cultivado una profunda conexión con la música desde
temprana edad, inspirada por un amplio espectro de géneros que abarcan desde el flamenco y el folk
hasta el new wave y el rock. Esta diversidad de influencias se refleja en la versatilidad de sus sets,
siempre eclécticos y en constante búsqueda de profundidad y envolvencia. Su estilo combina
registros que invitan a una inmersión gradual, comenzando con tonos cálidos y lentos que
evolucionan hacia ritmos más intensos y audaces. Durante su carrera, T.MODET ha explorado
territorios sonoros variados, desde el tech break y el old school hasta el breakbeat, y ha consolidado
su presencia en la escena musical de Barcelona, participando en festivales como MIRA y Primavera
Sound, además de colaborar en proyectos como Shakti Alliance y el colectivo Vila. Su música ha
resonado en espacios nacionales e internacionales, desde Berlín y París hasta Nueva York y Los
Ángeles.
Carlotto Rose, artista visual originario de las Islas Canarias y residencia entre Barcelona y México,
nacido en la década de los 90, comenzó a desarrollar su creatividad en la infancia, inspirada por las
vibrantes tonalidades de Tenerife sumadas a las imágenes que le venían de pronto a la cabeza como
visiones. Su primera y más directa influencia es "televisión liquida" de MTV, los primeros dibujos
que vio en México y que gracias a qué su hermana los grabó en VHS luego pudo verlos una y otra
vez hasta que se quemó la cinta. Desde temprana edad, exploró diversas expresiones artísticas,
desde la pintura y la escultura hasta la fotografía y la moda. Su trayectoria la llevó a Barcelona,
donde estudió cine y montaje, y encontró en el VJ un espacio de fusión entre su amor por la música
y el cine. En sus visuales, Carlotto Rose crea mundos imaginarios que trasladan al espectador a un
universo textural único, en el que se exploran temas como el nacimiento, el amor y la aceptación de
la mortalidad. Su obra ha sido expuesta en galerías de Barcelona y ciudades como Nueva York,
Moscú y Tokio. Además, ha colaborado en proyectos con marcas como OBEY y ha presentado
trabajos en galerías y festivales alrededor del mundo.
Juntos, T.MODET y Carlotto Rose han logrado una sinergia única que combina la profundidad
sonora con una visión visual rica en simbolismo, ofreciendo experiencias inmersivas que exploran

producer, and label owner widely regarded as a pivotal figure in the modern revival of jungle and breakbeat hardcore music. Emerging from East London, Reaper has carved out a distinctive niche in the electronic music scene by blending the raw, nostalgic energy of 1990s jungle with contemporary production techniques. His work is characterized by lush, atmospheric soundscapes paired with hard-hitting breakbeats, intricate drum programming, and a deep reverence for the genre’s roots. Since his debut in 2010, he has become a torchbearer for jungle’s resurgence, earning respect from both veteran "nuttahs" (a term of endearment for jungle enthusiasts) and a new generation of listeners.

### Early Life and Introduction to Music
Born in 1993, Tim Reaper grew up in a post-rave era London, where the echoes of jungle and drum & bass still lingered in the underground. Despite not experiencing the genre’s mid-90s heyday firsthand, Reaper’s fascination with its sound began in his teenage years. A defining moment came when he encountered “Super Sharp Shooter” by The Ganja Kru, a track that he has described as rearranging his brain “on a molecular level.” This experience ignited a passion for jungle, prompting him to explore its history and experiment with production. Armed with little more than a laptop and FL Studio—a setup he still uses today—Reaper began crafting tracks as a self-taught producer, immersing himself in the genre’s rich catalog of vintage obscurities and unreleased dubplates.

As a teenager, Reaper was an active member of online forums like Subvert Central, where he engaged with established producers and DJs. Despite his youth, he held his own in these tight-knit communities, talking a big game and absorbing knowledge from the scene’s pioneers. This early dedication laid the groundwork for his later success, giving him an encyclopedic understanding of jungle and drum & bass that belies his age.

### Career Beginnings
Tim Reaper’s musical journey kicked off in 2010 with his debut release, “Propa Tings,” a collaboration with producer Relapse, released digitally. Later that year, he dropped an explosive remix of DJ Trace’s “Final Chapta” on a white-label 12-inch vinyl, a move that garnered significant attention from the jungle community. The remix showcased his ability to honor the genre’s heritage while injecting his own energy, earning praise from purists and signaling his arrival as a serious talent.

From 2013 onward, Reaper’s output became increasingly prolific. He collaborated with a range of artists, including Detroit’s Sinistarr, Sheffield’s Kid Lib (owner of Green Bay Wax), and London’s Dwarde, releasing tracks on labels like 117 Recordings, Criterion Records, and Green Bay Wax. His productions during this period honed his signature sound: fast-paced breakbeats, chopped vocal samples, and a balance of gritty basslines with ethereal pads. In 2014, he began co-hosting mixes with Boston-based DJ Dev/Null for the blog “Back to the Oldskool,” further cementing his presence in the global jungle scene.

A notable personal milestone came in 2015 when, facing a failing computer, Reaper released *Need Money for Laptop*, a digital album of unreleased tracks. The title reflected his DIY ethos and resourcefulness, traits that have defined his career. By 2016, he and Dwarde launched the *Globex Corp* EP series on 7th Storey Projects, a Simpsons-themed collection that blended humor with high-quality jungle production, endearing him to fans and showcasing his playful side.

### Rise to Prominence
Reaper’s profile soared in the late 2010s and early 2020s as jungle experienced a broader revival. Labels like Blu Mar Ten Music (which released his 2017 single “All Right”), Amenology, Foxy Jangle, and Parallax Recordings became platforms for his work, while his relentless work ethic saw him churning out EPs, singles, and remixes at an impressive rate. Tracks like “More Lanterns” (2020, Repertoire) and “Toxic Tones” (2020, Beyond Electronix) highlighted his evolution, refining his sound while staying true to jungle’s core.

In 2020, Reaper founded Future Retro London, a label initially conceived as a nightclub concept. Future Retro quickly became a hub for his releases and those of like-minded artists, earning the Breakthrough Label award at DJ Mag’s 2021 Best of British awards. The label’s success underscored his growing influence, as did his nominations for Best Producer and Best Remix (for “Lanterns VIP”) at the same awards. His remix of DJ Krust’s “One Stop,” featured on the V Podcast in April 2025, further showcased his ability to reinterpret classics for modern audiences.

Reaper’s DJ sets and podcasts are as celebrated as his productions. Known for seamless mixes that weave together vintage rarities, unreleased dubplates, and contemporary cuts, he has performed across Europe, the United States, and Asia (including a 2023 tour with stops in Osaka, Seoul, and Singapore). His sets reflect his meticulous approach to selection, informed by years of digging through catalogs and studying the genre’s evolution.

### Musical Style and Influence
Tim Reaper’s music is a love letter to jungle’s golden era, drawing inspiration from pioneers like LTJ Bukem, Bizzy B, and DJ Trace. His productions often feature the hallmarks of classic jungle—amen breaks, sub-bass pressure, and soulful vocal chops—while incorporating modern production clarity. He describes his process as a constant refinement, likening it to adjusting a microscope’s depth field to achieve sharper focus. This dedication to craft has earned him the respect of original jungle heads, with his tracks receiving enthusiastic approval in nostalgic online groups.

Beyond production, Reaper’s influence extends to his role as a historian and educator. His appearance on Electronic Beats’ “Blind Test” series, where he outshone veterans like Bailey and Fabio in identifying 90s tracks, demonstrated his deep knowledge. Despite his introverted nature and skepticism of social media, he remains a vocal advocate for jungle’s growth, pushing for the scene to expand beyond its underground bubble without losing its soul.

### Personal Life and Philosophy
At 31 (as of April 2025), Reaper remains a private figure, wary of the spotlight and the chaos of free party scenes favored by some peers. He speaks with the authority of a seasoned veteran, a product of his lifelong commitment to jungle. His goals reflect the genre’s humble ethos—shifting a few hundred records and earning DJ play from the core community—yet he’s seized opportunities to elevate its profile, balancing ambition with authenticity.

### Legacy and Future
Tim Reaper stands at the forefront of jungle’s modern renaissance, a bridge between its past and future. His extensive discography, including standout releases like *Teletext EP*, *Meeting of the Minds* series, and *Hardcore & Rubble*, showcases a restless creativity that continues to evolve. With Future Retro London as his platform, he’s nurturing a new wave of talent while keeping the flame of breakbeat hardcore alive. As he told DJ Mag in 2020, “I’m under no illusion that in a year’s time none of these people might be interested in my music anymore,” a pragmatic outlook that fuels his relentless drive.

in 2024. As a leading producer and advocate for Brazilian talent, his Sónar set promises to be historic.', 'https://irjubpjnvgdhlyzigdpn.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/MySonar%20Videos//Vintage_Culture.mp4', 'BR', '02:00:00', '03:00:00', 'Vintage Culture is a force of nature. From a small-town dreamer to topping the
Billboard, Spotify, and Beatport charts, he has overtaken the electronic music world like
a tsunami, gracing the biggest stages and headlining festivals from Coachella to
Lollapalooza. Diamond, Platinum, and Gold certifications document his 1.5 billion
streams on Spotify alone. His journey is a testament to his relentless work ethic,
unwavering passion, and ever-evolving sound.
His rise began in a small town in Brazil, far from the excitement of Rio de Janeiro or São
Paulo. But his dreams were far from modest. He quickly carved out his name in the
Brazilian scene and set his laser focus on making waves internationally. During the
pandemic, he channeled his energy into creating over 200 tracks, leading to a new,
emotionally charged house sound.
This musical evolution gave birth to global hits such as "It Is What It Is" and "Nightjar,"
solidifying his presence on labels like Defected, Insomniac, Sony, and Ultra. His
collaborations with renowned artists like John Summit, and Moby, and remixes for Rufus
Du Sol, Maverick Sabre, Cassian, and Bob Moses further secured his reputation as a
versatile and influential force. Embraced by radio, his music rapidly became a mainstay
on the UK’s BBC Radio 1, Kiss FM, Capital FM, NRJ in France/Benelux, Slam FM in the
Netherlands, Triple J in Australia, and SiriusXM in the States.
Vintage Culture isn't just a prolific producer; he's a captivating DJ known for marathon
sets from sunset to sunrise, seamlessly blending various shades of house music. This
dedication has earned him residencies at iconic venues like Hi Ibiza, where he now
hosts his own night and T ao Group in Las Vegas, while simultaneously headlining the
main stages of T omorrowland, EDC, and Ultra Music Festival.
In his homeland of Brazil, Vintage Culture is a hero, a household name. He has
cemented his role as a national treasure through his altruistic work and promotions of
the electronic music scene. His own label and festival brand, Só Track Boa have
flourished, with 25,000 dedicated fans flocking to the festival at each stop throughout
Brazil. He has used these creative outlets to introduce Brazil’s most talented artists to
the international world. In 2023, he launched Vintage Is A Festival - a one-man festival
showcasing the stages and growth of his career while also focusing on the talent of
local artists outside of music, such as painters, abstract artists, and photographers.
Vintage Is A Festival has been an overwhelming success, selling out Brazil’s biggest
stadiums.
Vintage Culture’s accolades extend beyond the dance floor. He's been featured on the
cover of Rolling Stone Brazil, MixMag, and DJ Magazine in France, Spain, UK, and
recognized in Forbes' prestigious "30 Under 30" list.
In 2024, fans will witness the biggest event of his recording career: the release of his
debut album, Promised Land. Scheduled for release on May 24, Promised Land is the
culmination of four years of songwriting, recording, and production. With a pledge to
surprise, innovate, and certainly make fans dance, Promised Land will take fans on a
journey they’ll remember long after the last beat.
Vintage Culture's journey embodies the unwavering passion that fuels the electronic
